## High Ledge Homes and Restrictive Covenants {-}

*Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, June 2010. See expanded version in a book chapter, co-authored with Vianna Iorio and Jack Dougherty, in [On The Line](http://OnTheLine.trincoll.edu).*

West Hartford’s construction business boomed near the end of the Great Depression. Over 1,800 homes were built in town between 1937 and 1940, attracting city dwellers to the suburbs. But in at least one West Hartford neighborhood, the ability to buy one of these new homes depended on your race.

On July 23, 1937, R. G. Bent and Company purchased the 47-acre Wooley Estate on South Main Street for $30,000. The property was bound by Trout Brook to the east, South Main Street to the west, and Beach’s Vine Hill Farm to the south and the Hanson property to the north. During the Depression, the area became more valuable as a real estate development than it was as farmland.

Bent quickly hired land surveyors Osterling and Samuelsen to subdivide the land into 100 building lots across from Rockledge Golf Course. The first tract of land, that would become Bentwood and Ledgewood Roads, included eight house lots along South Main and eight along Webster Hill Boulevard. Between ten and twelve house lots ran along each side of the street for a total of 49 lots.

The R.G. Bent Co. built 34 homes on the property in 1938 and 1939. Less than two years after purchase in March 1940, the Bent Company sold the land to High Ledge Homes and established an “Agreement Concerning Building Restrictions” which can be found in Manuscript Volume 152 in the land records at the West Hartford Town Hall. Edward Hammel, President of High Ledge Homes, bought the property, and submitted an “Agreement Concerning Building Restrictions.”

The corporation wanted "to create a uniform plan of development" and it imposed nine restrictions on houses built on the property. Restriction (e) read:

> No persons of any race except the white race shall use or occupy any building on any lot except that this covenant shall not prevent occupancy by domestic servants of a different race employed by an owner or tenant.

According to the Agreement, homeowners could prosecute any person “violating or attempting to violate any such covenant...” The document established what could be considered a democratic body in the neighborhood in that the majority of property owners could prosecute others for violations. They could also vote to end the restrictions in 25 years (1965) or the restrictions would automatically extend every 10 years.

This restrictive covenant, based on race, is the first I have seen in writing in West Hartford. By word of mouth I had heard that in the 1930s and 1940s and into the 1950s, no Roman Catholics could live on Stoner Drive, the first street developed on “the mountain.” No Catholics could buy on Wood Pond or Sunset Farms or West Hill or Sunnyreach. According to another resident, the address of a house on the corner of Foxcroft Road and Fern Street was changed to Fern Street because no Jews were allowed on Foxcroft Rd. But how many of these restrictions actually appear in West Hartford in writing and on legal documents? They have been hard to find in writing.

When and why do these restrictions come about and when do they end? My friend Professor Jack Dougherty of Trinity College is studying just this question in his book-in-progress, *On the Line: How Schooling, Housing and Civil Rights shaped Hartford and its Suburbs*. His research on Hartford, West Hartford, Bloomfield and Avon is a fascinating comparison of development in these four towns, all of which have different characters, in part dependent on these restrictive covenants.

The right to have a restrictive covenant stems back to a Supreme Court case Corrigan v. Buckley decided in 1924. In 1921, after a neighborhood was built, white property owners in a District of Columbia neighborhood formed a white property owners association. The homeowners wrote a restrictive covenant that prevented the sale of property to African American citizens. But, when white owner Corrigan, within this neighborhood chose to sell her property to an African American, white neighbor Buckley brought suit to enforce the covenant and stop the sale of the house.

The District of Columbia Federal Court upheld the covenant and the Supreme Court, in a 9-0 decision, affirmed the decision by refusing to hear the case because, Justice Edward T. Sanford argued, the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction in the case.

Sanford argued that under the Fifth Amendment’s phrase that no person should “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law” limited the federal government, not individuals. The Thirteenth Amendment, he argued, did not protect individual rights of blacks. The Fourteenth Amendment referred to actions of the state, not of private individuals. The Supreme Court case, Corrigan v. Buckley reaffirmed the right of property owners to have restrictive covenants. This ruling allowed developers and neighborhoods to stop racial integration in housing. The 1917 case Buchanan v. Warley had opened the door to integration.

In 1948, the Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kramer found the restrictive covenants to be valid between parties that agreed on them, but argued that they could not be enforced because that would constitute a discriminatory state action, which the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited. Private parties could voluntarily follow restrictive covenants, according to the ruling, but they could not seek judicial enforcement because that would mean the state would have to take action that would be discriminatory.

The result of this case was that restrictive covenants remained in deeds, but were not enforceable. According to a West Hartford resident, when she bought her home in 1970, the real estate agent told her the restrictive covenant existed, but he properly reported that it could not be enforced.

This restrictive covenant helps to explain the town’s public willingness to try to restrict African Americans from living in the war housing built during World War II on Oakwood Avenue, Quaker Lane, and Elmhurst Drive. West Hartford’s small African American population in 1950 was not just by chance. And attitudes about Caucasians and African Americans living side by side in the 1940s may not have been so different here than they were in the south.

*Note: Thank you to Mary Everett, who formerly lived on Ledgewood Road for bringing the restrictive covenant to my attention. Thank you to Jack Dougherty and Katie Campbell for finding the restrictive covenant at the Town Hall. Also see the website “Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project” at <http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/covenants.htm> for information on how Seattle has addressed restrictive covenants in their city. Anyone who knows of restrictive covenants in their deeds, most likely written in the 1920s, 1930s or 1940s, please contact me.*
