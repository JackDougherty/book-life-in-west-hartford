## Public Art in West Hartford {-}

*Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, August 2008*

The West Hartford Art League is sponsoring Art Walk in September 2008, and as part of their celebration will include a self-guided public art walk. Though the concept of public art is not new, the local government’s sponsorship of the recent Busby sculpture “Bear,” denotes a change in public support for public art. The addition of a Charles Perry sculpture on the corner of South Main and Memorial Drive and the installation of a kinetic sculpture by Tim Prentice by the West Hartford Art League’s pond this fall will continue the partnership between the West Hartford Art League and the Town of West Hartford.

What is the history of the town and its public art?

A good first stop on a public art tour through the center is the Old Burial Ground. West Hartford’s first manifestation of public art can be seen in the two cemeteries on North Main Street. The Old Burial Ground, less than an acre in area, set up in 1719, has stones dating between 1725 and 1869. About 200 people are buried there. Look at the art on the pre 19th century gravestones. The Stancliff Shop in Middletown probably made James Watson’s stone. The floating punctuation, the uppercase lettering and the rosettes on the shoulders of the stone are all signatures of this shop. Stancliff popularized the rosettes’ use on stones.

The stones of Benjamin Colton (1713-59) and Stephen Keyes may have self-portraits on them. Lt. Joseph Gillitt’s gravestone has a skull, which reminded those who looked of death and resurrection. Gillit was one of the first 29 people to establish the church in the West Division in 1713. Find Rachel Marshfield’s stone in the southeast corner of the burial ground. Her stone has an hourglass showing that time had run out. It has two flowers, one alive, and one dead and severed by a scythe, showing the frailty of life.

In the 18th century, the church and the government were one and the same. Town meetings were held in the meeting house/church; landowners paid property taxes, which supported the church. Though individuals paid for their own headstones, the church/local government took care of the burial ground.

The Old North Cemetery, just north of the Old Burial Ground, next to the Baptist Church, is almost seven acres. Established in 1790 when the Old Burial Ground was filled, the cemetery still allows some descendants of those buried in this cemetery to be interred there. The monuments in this cemetery show the development of gravestone art. Gone are the death’s heads and poems to be replaced by standards like the urn and the willow tree. In this cemetery you’ll find a large monument to those who fought and died in the Civil War.

As the town turned from a farm village into a suburb, the number of public buildings increased. When Hall High was built in 1924 and the Town Hall and Library in 1936, there was also talk of public art. In December 1935, Walter O. Korder (1891-1962) was commissioned to paint his Connecticut History mural at Hall High School. He was one of 76 artists in Connecticut employed by the federal government’s Works Progress Administration (WPA). Two artists, Philip Smith and Francis C. Thwing were hired to assist.

It was not until 1947, however, that Korder completed his Connecticut murals. Korder began painting, but stopped when wartime conditions made it impossible to get the necessary paints and supplies to complete his work. He had to suspend the work for six years. The murals show Connecticut history from the Vikings to the hanging of John Brown in 1859. Some scenes include the landing of Thomas Hooker and his party in Hartford, the signing of the Connecticut Charter, and the founding of Yale. Korder was a legendary art teacher in West Hartford and by 1947, past president of the West Hartford Art League.

Korder’s paintings hang in two other public buildings in West Hartford. He has two paintings at Charter Oak Academy, one of Hansel and Gretel at the witch’s house and the other Winkin’, Blinkin’ and Nod, both painted in 1931. At Conard, Korder’s portrait of Frederick U. Conard hangs in the library.

While Korder was painting his mural, the public private collaboration on the Noah Webster statue was fraught with difficulty. Korczak Ziolkowski’s (1908-1982) Noah Webster statue was just recently refurbished and moved several hundred yards north on South Main Street to act as a beacon to Blue Back Square. As part of the agreement between the town and the Blue Back Square, the developers paid for refurbishing this statue of West Hartford’s favorite son.

West Hartford’s Town Council officially supported Ziolkowski’s carving of Webster. In an October 1940 news article in the *Hartford Courant*, the reported said “Town officials may acquire the marble portrait as a memorial.” Town leaders including Superintendent of Schools Lloyd Bugbee, Rev. Elden Mills of the First Church of Christ and the pastor of St. James Episcopal Church George Guiness all inspected a model of the statue at Ziolkowski’s house. By February 1941, Mrs. Russell Z. Johnston, chairman of the Noah Webster Sculpture Commission reported that she had received 700 contributions to pay for materials and labor of about $17,000. Those who canvassed the townspeople “reported that residents were very enthusiastic toward the project.”

Governor and Mrs. Robert Hurley who lived at 99 Outlook Avenue at the time, headed the list of sponsors. By May, the committee had raised $4,000 and Ziolkowski agreed to go ahead with the statue. Though the Town Council approved the plan and the placement of the statue on the new Town Hall’s lawn, they did not help monetarily. Ziolkowski donated his services and used the money to buy the stone and pay his assistants. Ziolkowski carved this classical sculpture from a single 32 ton block of southern marble. Ziolkowski never formally turned over the title for the piece to the town.

For those with good eyes, check the base of Ziolkowski’s statue where he decries the lack of support of the town. On one of the sculpted books at the base, Ziolkowski wrote: “For you I labored not for my own day, that by the word, men should know brotherhood. My Fellow Men! You have not understood, since each of you would go his separate way.” What began as a united effort by the town government, an artist, and the town’s residents ended with a lasting reminder of the tension over this piece of art.

The public enjoys works of art and the West Hartford Art League continues to advocate for more public art. In tough economic times, the Town Council weighs each penny of public money it spends, and that seems to be no different than it was 65 years ago.
