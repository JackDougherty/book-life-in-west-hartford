Wilson Preface These chapters help tell the story of the West Hartford, Connecticut community from first settlement to the present day. How does the identity of a community grow? Who are the people whose voices have not been heard? And how did the powerful use their voices? Who spoke and worked for equality, democracy, justice, rights and rebellion, all ideals delineated in our Declaration of Independence? Local history gives us a window into how life in a democracy works. Introduction Who tells our stories? And what do these stories tell about what we value? For 15 years, I wrote local history essays for the magazine, West Hartford Life. I’m not sure how I wrote more than 130 essays, each at least 1,000 words, while I was raising a family and teaching high school history full time. These monthly articles continually put me in the position of my Conard High School history students - a deadline, a topic, establishing a context, evidence, and ferreting out cause and effect. This work helped make me a better teacher and community member. I was able use my historian skills at the local level to help community members examine who we are as a town. As I wrote these articles, and as you read them, individually, and as a whole, think about how they define what we value as a community. What events included all types of people? Which events excluded people? Which reinforced who had power and which gave power to those who didn’t have it before? Whose voices were heard? What documents can give us a window into the past? Is the story about an individual or is it more about the context in which this individual lived? How do present day issues help to define what we want to know about the past? Author Tracey Wilson. Photo by Jack Dougherty My love for this town comes from the involvement of so many citizens in striving to build a better community: a place based on justice, equal opportunity, a desire to join together to attack problems, and a love for those who live here. That is not to say that our actions in this town are always just, or that there is equal opportunity for all. Not everyone is a joiner, and not everyone is loved. But I dare say that many in this town make it their work to move toward those noble goals. You will read here about equality and differences. For example, you’ll read about our first meeting house, Lemuel Haynes, Amos Beman, Thomas Barrows, when we became our own town, Edith Beach, Susie Butler Andrews, Dr. Caroline Hamilton, the League of Women Voters, attempts to build affordable housing, Korczak Ziolkowski, Soviet Jewish emigres, school Superintendents, people who died in the many wars, and about pioneer Olivia Shelton. Former Connecticut State Historian Chris Collier argued that he could teach United States History by teaching Connecticut history. There is much to be said for that sentiment. For the stories here about West Hartford teach us about equality, democracy, justice, rights and rebellion. Local history, too, can teach U.S. History. Acknowledgements So many people have helped me become the historian and community member that led to this book. I think of my high school history teacher, Pete Lynch from Granby Memorial High School, college professors Jim Miller, Kim Steele, and Joan Hedrick from Trinity College. Graduate school professors Mari Jo Buhle and Joan Scott each helped me find my voice. As a teacher, my department supervisors at Conard encouraged and supported me in teaching a Local History course, and did so for over 20 years. My students taught me much about what mattered and what stories had staying power. Thanks too, to the Town of West Hartford, and Mayor Jonathan Harris for naming me Town Historian in 2004. West Hartford Life provided a motivation and venue for my work. Thanks to Mark Jahne and others who encouraged me. And thanks to TurleyCT Community Publications for permission to publish the over 140 articles that first appeared in their magazine. I especially want to thank Prof. Jack Dougherty, who, when I was at a very low point, came to me asking if I would be interested in making the articles into an online book. Jack made things happen. His intern and my former Trinity student Vianna Iorio did much of the legwork to help me get the articles in order and provide searchable words, a short synopsis and a means to organize them. What a treat to have them both help me through a difficult time and keep me motivated. Thanks for their friendship and professional help, especially when I needed it most. Thank you to the Noah Webster House and West Hartford Historical Society, especially Jenn DiCola Matos and Sheila Daley. Sheila had the knowledge and the skills to help me find the primary sources which appear throughout the book. And she helped me find the illustrations and embedded them in the text, no small task. Thanks to the West Hartford Public Library, and especially to Martha Church who always encouraged me in my study of Local History. Her knowledge of the town is vast and she has documents at her fingertips. Their Local History Room keeps the power of local history alive. Thanks on a personal level to Liz Devine. We taught together for 37 years at opposite ends of town, for most of it, and then we retired together. We continue to talk history and teaching as we write curriculum and train young teachers. She is as good a friend as you’d ever find! And finally, my family - Peter, Adam, Brittany, Caroline and Billie - who delight in my love of history and find ways to keep me guessing. And, to Beth, who is the best partner a person could ever have and my best editor. She is supportive, fun, and curious, and she knows what I love. – Tracey Wilson, June 2018 "],

Lemuel Haynes Crossed the Color Line", " Colonial Life Equality and Difference in Colonial West Hartford Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, November 2000 “All men are created equal.” This grand statement appears in the Declaration of Independence written in 1776. Since the writing of the Declaration, Americans have thought a lot about the issue of equality in political, economic and social terms. Was there equality in the West Division of Hartford (as West Hartford was called before independence in 1854) by 1776? And, did colonial residents recognize economic and social differences? Landholding is one place to look for differences in wealth. When the proprietors divided the West Division land into long lots in 1671, they distributed it according to how much land each man owned in Hartford. Those who had large lots in Hartford received large ones here. There was no attempt in the move west to equalize fortunes; instead this land division reinforced the economic hierarchy that existed. At the same time, more Americans had the chance to own land than in England. Proprietors divided the abundant land among all sons in the New World, as opposed to only the first son in England. A look at colonial homes still standing in town gives a glimpse at the range of house sizes and thus the resources of individual families. A middling farmer built the Noah Webster House at 227 South Main. Built around 1748, the house originally had four rooms built around a center chimney. The Benjamin Colton House (c. 1770) at 25 Sedgwick Road and the John Wells Jr. House (c. 1766) at 505 Mountain Road both are substantially larger than the Webster House. They have five windows in front and two on each side, while the Webster House has three windows across the front and one on each side. The Gillet house, at 202 South Main Street is one of 18 remaining colonial homes in town. It was built by Asa Gillet, a grandson of Joseph Gillett, one of the first proprietors of the town in 1694. Asa Gillett farmed both sides of Main Street in the late 18th century and he traded with the merchant Joseph Webb in Wethersfield. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. This comparison tells us only so much, however. The houses of the poorest residents did not survive. Those who had not reached the middle-class status of the Websters might have lived in a cellar with a roof, or in a shack that did not withstand more than a few winters. Archaeologists in other New England towns have found the remains of such buildings. We have no sites or artifacts here because larger homes were built over these original, simpler structures. But we can hypothesize that the difference between rich and poor housing was greater than the examples left standing. Inventories taken at the time of a man’s death, are another way to assess the difference in wealth among West Division residents. Designated townspeople went into the deceased person’s home and listed everything found in each room. Today these inventories can be found at the Connecticut State Library. In the 1770s , the total value of the inventories of eight different West Division families (featured in Noah Webster House educational programs) ranged from about 300 pounds to 1,300 pounds. The types of goods owned by these farmers did not vary greatly. Most families had a Bible and perhaps one other book in their inventory. Wealthier families had more clothing, more looking glasses and more books. The biggest difference in wealth was the amount of land an individual owned. The Rev. Nathaniel Hooker, the second minister in town (1738-1770) who died at the early age of 32, had a list of books and drugs appended to his inventory, showing his educational background as both a minister and doctor. Though his estate was worth only about 550 pounds, Reverend Hooker had the most social prestige in the town because of his education and his position as minister. The presence of slavery in the West Division was a clear sign of inequality. At least 15 families owned people of African heritage between 1738 and 1827. We have the names of more than 40 people who were owned. Some bought their freedom, some were freed by the 1784 gradual emancipation law, and some died in slavery. Reverend Benjamin Colton owned what he named a “negro servant,” and Reverend Nathanael Hooker owned a man, a woman, and a child. Finally, the use of church records can tell something of the social structure within the town. In the late 18th century, there was but one church in town: the Fourth Congregational Church of Hartford. All townspeople had to belong to the church and paid taxes for its upkeep and the upkeep of the town. These records reside in the John P. Webster Library in the First Church (so-called after West Hartford became an independent town in 1854). In a First Congregational Church booklet from 1913 commemorating the 200th anniversary of the church, there is a description from the 1760s about how people were seated in the church. A church committee assigned those with the highest social, political and economic standing to the pews in the front. Church leaders designated a pew for “old maids” in the back of the church. African-Americans like Page and Lew and the widow of Jude (listed as Negro) were members in full communion of the church. They also sat in the back. People knew where they ranked by their seating in church. In a list of “Members in Full Communion” in December of 1764 from the Fourth Church, the only church in town, there is a clear differentiation between people by sex, race, marital status and social status. Titles such as captain, lieutenant and colonel distinguished military men. Leaders of the church were denoted as deacons. That Page and Lew were considered members in full communion at the church, however, is evidence that everyone could be full members of the church. Gender defined social status as well. Married women, like “Stephen Sedgwick’s wife” were listed as wives, not by their own names. Women considered “old maids,” such as Lydia Smith, were listed with their given name and surname, but many widows were noted as Widow Gillet, without the use of a given name. Where you sat in the pews each Sunday reminded those church goers of the social and economic hierarchy of the church members. In the 1770s, West Divisions residents saw the difference between rich and poor all around them. But the gap, in a small town like the West Division, was nowhere near as wide as it is today, where multi-million-dollar homes exist not too far from one-bedroom apartments. Yet the abundance of land gave more people the chance to be independent farmers and the chance at a higher standard of living than they would have in England. And, even with the distinctions between classes, there was a sense of equality of access. All residents had to attend the Fourth Church. All of them traded with John Whitman and Zaccheus Butler. While they were reminded of their social standing in church every Sunday, they all shared the right to vote on church matters, and those who owned land voted on town matters. All West Division residents had certain basic inalienable rights, but they clearly knew their place within the established hierarchy of their small New England town. America Exposed as a Divided Society Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, October 2005 Hurricane Katrina washing away the veneer of New Orleans, bearing the economic reality of American life, led me to reflect on our own community. How clear were the class, race and gender differences in the West Division at the time of the American Revolution? How did people separate and include one another in this community? Economically, there was a clear difference in wealth in town by the second half of the 18th century. In 1766, Colonel John Whiting, former Treasurer of the Connecticut Colony, died at age 73. He was cited as the wealthiest man in the West Division. He lived north of Albany Avenue. In April 1768, Timothy Goodman’s house burned to the ground. The Connecticut Courant reported that the house “was entirely consumed, together with all his household furniture, clothes, &amp;c. which were very rich and costly, about 200 bushels of grain, and a considerable sum of money.” These same men who were amassing wealth may also have had indentured servants and enslaved people and/or apprentices in town. Jude, enslaved by Stephen Sedgwick, ran away in 1774. Bristow bought his freedom from Thomas Hart and Sarah Whitman Hooker in 1775. Once the gradual emancipation act passed in 1784, a number of African Americans appeared in the church records dying in a pauper status. A number of indentured servants and apprentices were part of the West Division community as well. In 1768, an apprentice about 19 years of age named Moses Cook ran away from Ashbel Wells. Cook “carried away a great coat, a good suit of brown cloth, yellow buttons and sundry other articles of cloathing.” By law, anyone who found him was forbidden from hiding or employing the runaway. Wells did not offer a reward for his return. September 1784, an 18 year old named Truman Merrill ran away from Samuel Stanley. The advertisement in the Connecticut Courant said Merrill was about five foot ten and was well built with “short curl’d hair.” He worked Stanley’s clothier’s shop and Stanley believed Merrill would try to get work at this trade again. Stanley offered a reward of one shilling and sixpence. This Connecticut Courant runaway ad, August 9, 1774, is typical in describing what the runaway Jude was wearing and carrying. Note that Jude had a forged pass, indicating that either he was literate or he knew someone who would forge a pass. The owner, Stephen Sedgwick (1731-1792) married three times and had 10 children by his second wife, between 1762 and 1781. When Jude ran, Sedgwick was 43 years old and had 7 children. Source: The Connecticut Courant and Hartford Weekly Intelligencer (1774-1778); Hartford, Conn. 09 Aug 1774: 3. In 1793, Charles Stedman, a lad of 18 ran away from West Division resident Francis F. Olmsted. A reward of two dollars was offered to the person who returned him. Olmsted described him wearing a London smoke coat, a stitched vest and brown trousers. As early as 1791, there were ads in the paper about Charles Webster’s store where he had just received a fresh supply of European Indian goods, cloth and crockery ware. A customer could pay with “cash, country produce, tow cloth, linen check, clean cotton and linen rags,” all items produced in the West Division. In 1797, an ad for Webster’s store advertised that he had received goods from New York including broad cloths, plain and figured cashmere, flannels, vest shapes, chintzes, calicoes, satins, Persians, plain silk, and many other types of cloth. He also offered crockery, hardware and groceries. The ability to trade for goods in the store is a sign that farmers could produce more than they could consume. Their production depended to a great degree on the amount of land they farmed and whether they also had a trade. Still, all 1,000 residents must have felt like they were part of the community. The availability of land made life in America different than it was in England and spread opportunity around. Yet by the 1750s, land in the Connecticut colony was almost all being farmed. In 1754, Noah Webster, Sr. subscribed to land in Susquehannah County in the northern part of Pennsylvania. A man in Windham organized the subscribers. All the subscribers in the West Division lived near Webster on Main Street. Webster believed this land was controlled by the Connecticut colony because the charter gave the colony a right to all land westward. The French and Indian War broke out in 1756 and fighting continued to 1761. In 1762, settlement began in the Susquehannah. In 1763, as a result of the Treaty of Paris ending the French and Indian War, the King in Council banned settlement on the Susquehannah land. There was concern among Connecticut’s political leaders about this land. Connecticut had an elected governor and by the late 18th century the citizens feared that this right would be taken away if they caused any trouble and the British in turn would appoint a royal governor like in Massachusetts. In 1769, opponents of of the Susquehannah land felt settlement there jeopardized Connecticut’s Charter which allowed for the citizens to elect their own governor. The General Assembly replied in 1774, by extending Connecticut’s jurisdiction over the Susquehannah Company’s claim in the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania. Thus, those who had the means could speculate in land out west, increasing their wealth in relationship to those who could not invest. Religion provided a sense of community in New England, but it was clearly a hierarchical community. The Congregational Church was the established church; all had to pay a tax for the support of the minister, and it was the only church in town until 1859. The first two ministers of the West Division were Benjamin Colton and Nathaniel Hooker. Both men graduated from Yale College. Colton graduated just 13 years after it was founded and became a minister in the West Division in 1714. He served for 46 years until 1759 and earned his fame as a solid preacher. Nathanael Hooker graduated from Yale in the late 1750s and was hired straight away; he was known to be a brilliant man. He died young at age 33 in 1770. A 1764 list of members in full community at the Fourth Church of Christ Congregational revealed all levels of people who belonged to the church including a colonel, a lieutenant, several captains, deacons, “negroes,” widows, wives, and single women listed by their own names. Anyone could be part of this church, though within it, people’s ranks were clear by the seating arrangement, decided upon by the deacons. Women could be members in full communion, but widows sat in the back and wives were known by their husband’s names. The Reverend Nathaniel Hooker understood that for women’s education, his community could not offer all he wanted for his daughter. For her, he felt, it was necessary to leave the community to get a good education. In his will he wrote that, my said Daughter Ruth have a better and more polite Education than she can possibly have in the parish of West Division where she was born, and that for this purpose, She be sent to Boston or elsewhere as her circumstances will allow and prudence dictates, and thereby empower her Uncles James and Horace Hooker and her Aunt Eunice Ellery… [to carry out this desire]. For Ruth Hooker, the mores and services of the community would not allow her to develop in a way that her father envisioned so she had to leave. The community in which she lived did delineate between people by gender, race and class. Clearly many of those divides could be considered even deeper in the late 18th century than they are today. The Rev. Benjamin Colton and the Great Awakening Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, February 2009 The story of the Rev. Benjamin Colton, the first minister in the West Division, is a story of stability and tradition. He served the Fourth Congregational Church of Hartford here in the West Division for 46 years. Settlers traveled to attend the First or Second Congregational Church on Main Street in Hartford when the West Division of Hartford was settled in the 1690s. By 1711, local residents wanted to have their own church. When the settlers applied for a separate parish, there were 27 families with 164 family members here. According to their petition, seven houses had just recently been built, a sign that the area was growing. The petitioners claimed that there was enough land to support 90 families as they tried to make their case for their own church. Connecticut’s General Court (now known as the General Assembly) granted the West Division the ability to have its own church, the Fourth Congregational Church of Hartford. On February 24, 1713, ministers in the Hartford area ordained Benjamin Colton to become the pastor of the new church. Colton took on his ministry in the first meetinghouse. It was a plain building, built in 1712, at the site of the Veterans Memorial on the corner of North Main Street and Farmington Avenue. It was a square wooden, unheated building, with a pyramid roof, small windows, small galleries, a wooden pulpit and rough-hewn benches. This building served the church and the town for 30 years. The new congregation had 29 members. To become a member of any Puritan congregational church, parishioners publicly confessed their faith. There were 12 husband-wife couples that belonged to the church as well as five men, one wife without her husband and a widow. This group was Colton’s first congregation. Benjamin Colton studied for the ministry and graduated from Yale College in 1710. He was 21 when he took the pulpit. He was from a family of 18 children and grew up in Longmeadow, Mass. His grandfather emigrated from England. Colton started as a trial candidate in his position until in October 1713, at age 23, when he was hired for a series of years. He married Ruth Taylor two months later. They had four children and in 1725 at age 32, she died. Colton was a widower for about one year. He then married Elizabeth Pitkin and they had five children. Elizabeth had her fifth child at age 47. This growing family became an integral part of the town. Colton’s church grew in its early years, as did the population of the town. Not much is known about his preaching, as he only published two sermons. But he was clearly an effective leader, as the congregation kept him on and the church kept growing. The First Great Awakening in the 1730s increased his attendance even more, but led to controversy because Colton was not a supporter of this Great Awakening. Colton was a religious leader in Connecticut. In 1737, he was selected to deliver a sermon to the newly elected representatives in the new state house that was built in 1719. In his “election sermon” he urged the legislators to get back to God by cleaning up their moral lives. He felt as though there were too many sins including “uncleanness,” pre-marital sex and the enormous amount of rum consumption, particularly among legislators. If, according to Colton, legislators were more moral, they could be more successful. Colton stood up for traditional values. Even with his colony-wide stature, an outside authority had to come to settle things down at Colton’s church due to the intrusion of the Great Awakening. This religious revival tested the authority of Congregational ministers, their education and their message. In 1734, Northampton’s Jonathan Edwards began the “awakening” revival, encouraging his parishioners to be more emotional in their faith and put their lives in the hands of God. Conversions were personal, but not public confessions. George Whitefield’s revival tour in 1740 and 1741 caused a stir. The young English Episcopalian evangelist was emotional, enthusiastic and convincing at his first stop in Boston, where churches seemed unable to contain the crowds that came to hear him. He preached up to 16 times per week. Converts cried out, wailed and jerked their bodies and made the settled ministers uneasy. Whitefield preached in nearby Suffield, East Windsor, Hartford and Wethersfield. Colton and other settled preachers were upset with Whitefield’s invective against settled ministers who had not been taken up by the revival. He denounced their education at Yale and their lack of emotion in the pulpit. Whitefield’s message was taken even further by the Rev. James Davenport of Southold, Long Island, who in 1742 vehemently denounced the Congregational ministry and in New London arranged for lay converts to burn the symbols of what he thought was wrong with material goods and symbols of learning, including their clothing, ornaments and books. The Great Awakening moved many of Colton’s parishioners and Colton and Reverend Wadsworth in Hartford were both worried. But Colton remained in the pulpit, as officials from outside parishes came and settled things down. The fact that Colton continued his ministry until 1759 showed that there was at least some victory for what were known as the “Old Lights.” His church remained the only one in the West Division until the Episcopal Church in the 1840s. However, it seems clear that he had to change his message to adapt to the ideas of the Great Awakening, even if he didn’t like it. Colton’s tenure of 46 years at the First Church was a testimony to the importance of his traditional role of the ministry that he learned at Yale. There is no doubt that the Great Awakening jarred him and his fellow ministers, but with their mutual assistance, they sustained the monopoly that the Congregational Church had on religion in Connecticut for at least another 70 years. African-Americans in the 18th Century West Division Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, April 2001. The author thanks Sally Whipple, who collected these documents when she was director of the Noah Webster House. In 1893, Bernard Christian Steiner wrote the following in A History of Slavery in Connecticut: In general, Connecticut has little to be ashamed of in her treatment of the Negroes. She treated them kindly as slaves and freed them gradually, thus avoiding any violent convulsion… Her treatment of the slaves was almost always kind and generous. A master, in true patriarchal style, regarded them as in truth a part of his family. With the coming of the revolution and the struggle of the Colonists for freedom, a feeling arose that it was not just to hold other men in bondage and as a result, importation of slaves was forbidden in 1774. How much truth is there to Steiner’s assessment of the treatment of enslaved people in Connecticut? Were they treated kindly? Were the slave masters generous? Were enslaved people treated as part of the family and was the slave trade ended because of the ideology of freedom, which was so prevalent during the years leading up to the American Revolution? How did Steiner come to his conclusions? The Public Records for the Colony of Connecticut, October 1774 reveal a far different reason for ending the slave trade in Connecticut than Steiner offers. “An Act for prohibiting the Importation of Indian, Negro, or Molatto Slaves” starts with the phrase, “Whereas the increase of slaves in this colony is injurious to the poor and inconvenient”… The legislators of the General Court in Connecticut were moved more by economic and political or moral reasons. From the point of view of lawmakers, enslaved people took work away from the poor. Each town was responsible for taking care of the poor and the more enslaved Africans there were, it seemed, the more white poor there were. When legislators ended the slave trade, they acted out of their own self interest more than out of their commitment to liberty for all. “Run-away” advertisements from the Connecticut Courant reveal that many enslaved people chose to flee rather than serve as a slave. In August 1774, Jude ran away from Stephen Sedgwick, a resident of the West Division of Hartford, now known as West Hartford. Jude was described as a “molatto servant man… about 21 years old, about five feet, eight inches high.” In the West Division, enslaved people were sometimes called servants. Stephen Sedgwick’s probate record confirms that Jude was owned; he is listed in the record as “my Negro Boy Jude” on the line just above “all my sheep and all my swine.” Perhaps one could argue that Sedgwick was generous to Jude. Jude ran away with a claret-colored coat, two waistcoats, three pair of trousers, a pair of leather breeches and three shirts. He traveled with a forged pass. Whether Jude wrote the pass, we do not know. Masters describe their property carefully and knew their clothing down to the type of buttons. His wardrobe leads one to believe that Jude was not destitute, but despite Sedgwick’s generosity, Jude reacted in a way that questions whether he was being “kindly,” and “as a member of the family.” The owner offered a $20 reward. There is some evidence of good treatment in the church. John Whiting owned Page, who was listed in the Congregational Church records as a member of the church. Page also had economic power. During the winter of 1740-41, he bought cloth, thread and stockings from merchant John Whitman as recorded in his account book. These transactions lead us to believe that Page actually earned wages and had some economic autonomy. Perhaps this is an example of the master-slave relationship Steiner was describing. Steiner’s definition of a stable system based on family loyalty was put to the test in the 1790s. With the African uprising and revolution in Haiti between 1791 and 1794, Connecticut residents grew more nervous about the possibility of a slave revolt. A newspaper article from the Connecticut Courant on September 19, 1791 reported on the “Insurrection of Negroes” in which the Negroes “destroyed all the plantations by fire; that they massacred without distinction every white man in their power; that Negroes are in immense bodies; that they have cut off all communication with any part of the country.” The newspaper reported that the U.S. sent boats to Haiti to rescue the white women and children and to send them to Jamaica or Cuba. Seemingly the fear of slave revolt had to be stronger in the South, where in a state like South Carolina, there were counties with more than 75% African slave population. Connecticut’s slave population made up only about 3% of the total population. However, in an alarming run-away ad in the Courant in 1794, Charles Churchill, a Wethersfield resident and owner of Jack, “a yellowith Negro who speaks French, Spanish and broken English” declared that Jack was a “cunning, wicked, blood-thirsty fellow who drawed his knife and cut a gentleman.” Churchill went on to lambaste the legislature’s gradual emancipation act of 1783 because he believed freedom would only encourage freed men to cut the throats of the white people, “which would shortly be the consequence as hath been the case in the French islands, where thousands of white people have been cruelly murdered by the same act of liberality.” This reaction does not seem like the actions of a slave or slave master who had a generous paternal relationship with the slaves as Steiner argues. Joanne Pope Melish in her book, Disowning Slavery: Gradual Emancipation and Race in New England (1998), argues that before the Civil War, New England’s leaders were pushed to establish an ideology in opposition to that of the South which requires them to forget about their oppression and exploitation of African-Americans. Bernard Steiner must have used sources of slaveowners, not the enslaved to write his history; diaries of whites, not run-away ads, to establish what seemed like a beneficial relationship for both slave and slaveholder. A look at 18th-century primary documents reveals a world of tension between owner and owned. Personal rebellion on the part of the enslaved instilled fear in the slaveholders trying to uphold this economic, political and social institution. The West Division was not immune to these tensions. While all people understood the concept of freedom, not all experienced it. Whitman on Slavery June 2018 This list was written on the back of a note about a mortgage deed sent to West Hartford’s Town Clerk, Henry C. Whitman (1864-1952), sometime between 1901 and 1914. This is just part of the document penned, most likely by Whitman, which lists all “negro” Baptisms, Owners of the Covenant, Members of the Church, and Deaths, gleaned from the pages of the First Church of Christ West Hartford’s vital records. Whitman found that between 1738 and 1827, as many as 50 people of African descent lived in the West Division of Hartford (now West Hartford) and most of them were enslaved. Bristow Middle School (2005) commemorates one of those men. Bristow was part of a larger community of what were denoted in Church Records as “negro servants.” At the Noah Webster House archives, in the Whitman Collection, you can find this 7 inch wide by 6 inch long legal letter, folded once. The letter has no date and fewer than 50 words. The letter reads: Town Clerk, West Hartford, Conn. Dear Sir:- Enclosed find a mortgage deed from Henry A. B. Day to this Company of certain property on Westland Avenue, which kindly record and return to us, together with your bill for recording. Yours Very Truly , C?? P. Day Secretary Enclosure Town Clerk Henry Whitman compiled this list of enslaved people of African descent who lived in the West Division (currently West Hartford) between 1738 and 1827. Imagine his reaction to identifying over 30 people, two of whom were owned by his ancestors. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. When Town Clerk Whitman received the letter, probably in the early 1900s when Westland Avenue was being developed by Henry Day and his father’s construction company, he filed the mortgage deed and kept the note on his desk. Then Whitman used the piece of paper to record what had been lost from memory, and possibly what he thought was lost from the story of the town’s past. Whitman not only copied them all out, he analyzed what he recorded. Many West Hartford residents are surprised to learn that so many people of African descent in the West Division of Hartford were owned by town leaders, ministers, and the wealthier sorts and that so many enslaved people lived here. In 1790, at the time of the first census, there were close to 1,000 people who lived here, in about 150 families. Of those, at least 25 of these families – as many as 15% – owned people of African descent at some point in their family’s history. On the back of this letter, under the heading “Slaves in West Hartford - from church records,” Whitman wrote out the names and made these categories: Baptisms Owned the Covenant Admitted to Membership Deaths He listed the names from the church records under each of these headings, documenting men, women and children who were enslaved between 1738 and 1827. In all, Whitman wrote, Record is found of some 30 or more actual slaves, or freed slaves 1738-1827. At least one saw war service, or something approaching it, “Prot.” who died in camp at Ticonderoga. Back side of the letter, with Whitman’s list of names of enslaved people, based on church records. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. “Prot.” is listed under Deaths with the following note: “1776 Sep – Prot. servant of John Whitman, Jr. in ye Camp Ticonderoga.” Here Henry must have stopped when he wrote his own surname, Whitman, realizing that John was his ancestor. The first in the list is Hannibal, negro servant to Thomas Hosmer, baptised in 1738. Thomas Hosmer was the grandson of one of the first proprietors, also Thomas Hosmer, who owned at least 300 acres north of the center. Just north of where the American School for the Deaf is today, his father, Stephen Hosmer, built the first mill in town. Stephen, according to Town Historian Nelson Burr, “became one of the richest landlords, farmers and traders in the Connecticut Valley.” He became a communicant of the Fourth Church of Hartford in 1725 under Pastor Nathaniel Hooker. He married Susanna Steel in 1734. According to Whitman’s notes, his “negro servant Hannibal” was baptized on November 5, 1738. Five months later, in April 1739, Thomas and Susanna had their first child Thomas who was baptised. In 1742, Thomas bought a second man, “Hercules (Negro serv’t of Thomas Hosmer),” who was baptised in that year. In 1742, Thomas was chosen Moderator of the church and re-elected through the 1760s. He was one of the citizens voted to take care of the schools, and to help build a new school house. In 1757, he took on the label Esq. In 1761, Whitman catalogued under “Deaths,” Feb. 24 Hercules (Negro Serv. to Thos Hosmer), age 32. In January 1777, Thomas Hosmer wrote his will and died in that same month. In his will, he freed Hannibal: I have given my negro Hannibal his home and yet by the law he may be chargeable to my Estate if he shall be impotent and unable to provide for himself, if such a thing should happen I order my six sons to provide for his prosperity in equal proportion, but if he be lazie and idle and spend his time foolishly I desire that they will take care that the selectmen will bind him out. The church records reflect his status as a free man by listing Hannibal’s death as transcribed by Whitman: 1779 July 13 Hannibal A Negro Man Old Age We don’t know if Whitman actually saw that Hannibal had been freed in copying out these records, if he hadn’t seen the will. But one piece of his analysis leads us to believe he did: If Thos. H. Hooker was 1st to free his slaves Capt. Keyes seems [to] have been last. The negro slaves were apparently generally set free in West Hfd Parish at end after the time of the Revolution 1775-1791. In support of this conclusion is the term “negro man” instead of “servant” first recorded in 1778 + appears commonly after that. Why did Whitman transcribe these records? Did he want to know that his ancestors owned Prot. and Rubin, a Black Boy? I wonder if he ever showed the list to anyone or if he shared the information with his wife, his children, or the leaders of the town? Was it only for his own edification, for his own understanding of the colonial world? We do know he kept the sheet and it made it from the church records to the Whitman Collection at the Noah Webster House. Now the Witness Stones project will shine a brighter light on these women, men, and children who have mostly been forgotten. These men and women helped build our community and our churches through their work, yet, for so long we only recognized them as property here. Acknowledging the existence of this inhumane system of slavery is a first step in addressing issues of race in our community today. It must have been a jarring step for Whitman as well. The Sarah Whitman Hooker House Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, January 2005 A house can tell a story. Take the Sarah Whitman Hooker house on the south side of New Britain Avenue east of Main Street. With its beginnings in 1720, it survives today as the oldest structure in the town. The house is owned by the town, but limited access to the house has not allowed its story to be heard by very many people. The structure was built about 50 years after lots were first divided in the West Division. Split in the late 17th century, people started to move here after the fear of the Indians died away with the end of King Philip’s War (1676). By the 1680s, Stephen Hosmer built a mill on Trout Brook where it crosses North Main and owned 310 acres of land. In 1710 and then again in 1711, citizens of the West Division, 27 families and 164 people, petitioned and got its own church which became the Fourth Church of Hartford. The Sarah Whitman Hooker House, 1237 New Britain Avenue, was built pre-1740 around a tavern room, probably the oldest section of a building in West Hartford. The home has been used as a tavern, a one family home, a prison during the Revolution, a boarding house, a restaurant and inn, and since 1976, a museum owned by the Town of West Hartford. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. Date: 1882 Ten years later, John Seymour purchased the land on which the house stands from Stephen Steel. In Seymour’s 1747 will, he mentions his “mansion house on Four Mile Hill in the West Division.” In colonial days this location was called Four Mile Hill – four miles west of the Old State House on the South Road to Farmington. The structure began as one room with a chamber above and was probably first used as a tavern. Soon after, Seymour added onto it, making it a seven room house by 1747, at the time of Seymour’s will. Seymour’s son Timothy held a license for a tavern in 1733. Next to the meeting houses, the taverns were the most important centers of village life in colonial America. In the mid-1770s, Sarah and Thomas Hooker moved into the house on the South Road. Sarah Whitman Hooker was the daughter of John Whitman, a prominent town merchant and political leader in the 18th century. The extensive list of household furnishings and goods which her father gave her on her marriage are enumerated in his account book and thus provide a glimpse into the material nature of her life. This account book can be found at the Connecticut Historical Society. Thomas Hart Hooker went off to war in May 1775, right after the first battle at Lexington and Concord, leaving his wife and two children ages three and five. He died of pneumonia six months later during the siege of Boston. Hooker’s slave Bristow bought his freedom before his master left to fight. It seems that Hooker also had a slave named Amboy, and according to an 1882 photograph American Revolution, the house was home to a slave named Amboy who planted an Elm tree on the property in 1769 (cthistoryonline.org). I question the date recorded on the photograph, because it wasn’t until 1777 with the first American victory over the British at Saratoga, that there was a systematic planting of Elms in the center of Elmwood by Capt. Ebeneezer Faxon. There is no evidence of slave quarters at the house, but it is clear that Hooker owned slaves. Eighteenth century inventories seem to reveal that not more than one black lived on the premises at one time. During the American Revolution, after she was widowed, Sarah Whitman Hooker was asked to “keep” Philip and his son Andrew Skene, Tories who were taken as prisoners. Hartford had a “Committee Appointed to Take Care of Prisoners” that received their orders from Governor Jonathan Trumbull. Hooker was charged to “confine him on his parole of Honor not to go out of the bounds of Hartford . . And provide. . .[him] with suitable lodgings and entertainment in some remote part of the town of Hartford.” Philip Skene was the Loyalist Governor of both Forts Ticonderoga and Crown Point in upstate New York. The Skenes were native born, not English soldiers. A report in January of 1776 claimed that over 20 people gathered outside the Hooker homestead to harm the prisoners. Purportedly, Hooker calmed them down and they dispersed. In the early 1800s, Sarah Whitman Hooker added on to the house. She had the central chimney removed and in turn built twin chimneys on the east and west sides of the house. It is a typical five bay center hall Georgian style home, with clapboard siding and 12 over 12 double hung windows. One chimney has been rebuilt after it was destroyed by fire in the 20th century. A man named Jedediah Mills lived there in 1807 while Hooker owned the house. He had a taverner’s license for several years in the early 1800s. Still, again in the mid-19th century it became a tavern under the name the Sheaf of Wheat. In the 19th century, West Hartford remained a farming town. By the mid-19th century, farming became more specialized, particularly in dairy. Just to the north of the house, Charles Beach built his Vine Hill Farm and by 1900, the farm was famous for “baby’s milk.” The Hooker house, by then owned by the Beach dairy farm, was used as a boarding house for workers from the Vine Hill Farm. By the early 20th century, West Hartford transformed into a suburb and the Beach family sold its farm in the 1920s. They donated a good portion of their land to the town in the form of Beachland Park in the early 1930s. Once the farm stopped producing, the Hooker house changed from the boarding house, to a restaurant and inn and that was known as the Sarah Whitman Hooker House. By 1976, the town of West Hartford owned the house and leased it to the West Hartford Bicentennial Trust to be open to the public as a museum. It was renovated through the efforts of the Fran Fransson. Her recent death has left the house in the same trust under the behest of her children. The house is on the National Historical Register. To interpret an historical home, usually the trust decides on a time period, and certainly this house has rich ties to the Revolutionary War period. At the same time, the changes in its structure and use tell much about the history of the town in the 19th and 20th centuries as well. If the house was open more, the citizens who own it could learn more of the richness of the story in three dimensions. Ye Olde Burying Ground Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, January 2002 Historians have several motives when they analyze artifacts and documents. We try to get a good story from them, have them make connections among people, make them capture a moment, and show how they reflect change. A visit on an afternoon in West Hartford’s Old Burying Ground on 30 North Main Street will provide you with the best light to read the stones and a way to understand the connections and tensions between people in a colonial community. In West Hartford’s Old Center Burying Yard, whose first burial was in 1725 and whose last was in 1868, there are differences in how the dead were memorialized, depending on wealth and status, gender, race, and era in which they were buried. During the Great Depression (in 1934), workers for the federal government’s Works Progress Administration surveyed the 137 graves and recorded their findings. With today’s data base computer capacity, it is easy to make a demographic study of those 137 people (though there are only dates for 134). There are 64 women and 73 men recorded. The statistics show that life was good in the West Division of Hartford, especially in comparison to what some had left in England, and what some of the first settlers had suffered in the early 17th century. Taken by decade, the most people died in their 70s. Once people lived to be 10, their chances of survival, and even living into their 80s and 90s, were quite high. Thomas Merrell, born in 1714, the year after the first church was erected in the West Division, died at age 100. Old Burying Ground Burials, by age and gender Today, more women live into their later years, but in colonial times, this seemed not to be the case, with more men than women living into their 80s and 90s. Many women died in childbirth. Rachel Webster, first wife of Abraham, (the oldest brother of Noah Jr.) died at age 21, in childbirth. Her infant was never named and died after 7 days. While more men than women died in their 20s, more women than men died in their 30s and 40s, perhaps showing that childbirth became more dangerous, the older the woman. When you walk into the burial ground, you walk into the “new” section, which has burials from the 19th century. The old section, which is about two-thirds of the acreage, fills the northern section of the yard. You can immediately see a difference in the size of the stones. None in the old section are more than three feet high. The new section has two large obelisks that commemorate the Talcott (of Talcott Junior High and Talcott Mountain fame) and Stanley families. By the 19th century, the idea of individualism had made its way into American society and the large size of the tombstones shows that wealthy families wanted to distinguish themselves from others. In the colonial section distinctions between the rich and poor are evident, but the difference is not as pronounced. Differences can be noted in the size of stones, the existence of a footstone and elaborate carving. The largest stone, though, is not based on wealth, but on status in the community. It commemorates the death of Reverend Nathaniel Hooker who passed away in 1770 at age 32 after serving the Congregational Church for 12 years. His stone is the only tablestone in the burial ground, but is in a sad state of disrepair. The four pedestals collapsed a long time ago and are stored at the Noah Webster House. The bottom slab and the top of the table can be viewed in the burial ground. The full inscription on the “table” details Hooker’s contributions to the town and champions his role as the best-educated man in the community. He was known as a brilliant man who ministered well. His role as doctor, however, did not serve him well in that he treated himself with mercury, leading to his demise. This tablestone can be found in the center of the east side of the burial ground. Men’s graves tended to be larger than women’s and more elaborate. Samuel Stanley, who died at age 38 in 1787, had both a headstone and a footstone and his stone is much larger than that of his wife, Anna, who died at age 33 in 1780. Anna had no footstone. This reflected women’s partnership with men, for they are buried next to one another, but also represents the patriarchal society in which they lived. Only one African American’s grave is marked in the burial ground, though I believe more are buried there. A man by the name of Bristol has a gravestone standing alone in the northwest corner. His stone reads, “Bristol, An African, Died 1814.” It is a simple but powerful remembrance of a man who bought his freedom from Thomas Hart Hooker in 1776 and who gained a reputation for his agricultural knowledge in his adult life. West Division farmers often consulted him. However, he could not be buried “among” them, and he was only given one name on his tombstone. Like his membership in the church, his location was separate in the burial ground. A walk in the Old Burying Yard brings you back to another place and time. But it also jars you with the underside of life in the 20th century. The gravestones are in a bad state of disrepair. Trees and weeds compromise the stones. Lichens grow. And the writing on many of the stones is no longer readable. Vandalism from 1990 when 34 stones were damaged has still not been repaired. Can we afford to leave this window on the past in such disrepair? What does this tell us about our connection with those who came before us? A Look at The Merrells Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, March 2002 When Jacob Merrell died from an accidental fall on his pitchfork, his wife Mary Merrell was left widowed. She never remarried, and lived in the West Division until her death in 1792. Surviving as a widow at that time in history was challenging, as it was seemingly impossible to live as a single person in an 18th century household. Mary stands out because she seemed to do quite well as a widow, probably through the support of her seven children. How did Mary do more than just survive for the 21 years after her husband died? The Merrells lived on the Farmington Road, now known as New Britain Avenue on their farm where Wolcott Park is located today. Samuel and Jonathan Skinner, Joseph Skinner, Allyn Seymour, and Charles Seymour were her neighbors. At the top of the hill, on the corner of New Britain Avenue and South Main Street stood a one-room schoolhouse for the south end of town. Mary grew up in Wintonbury Parish (now Bloomfield), and married Jacob Merrell in the 1750s. Jacob was 41 at the time of their first child’s birth. When Jacob died at age 57, he and Mary had four girls and three boys who ranged in age from 16 to 4. Mary bore children in 1755, 1757, 1758, 1760, 1762, 1766 and 1767. Thus was the life of a farming woman. According to Blackstone’s four-volume legal code written in 1765, married women were literally “covered” by their husband’s authority. Her “very being or legal existence,” he wrote was “consolidated into that of her husband; under whose wing, protection and cover she performs everything.” As a married woman, Mary Merrell could not own or buy property in her own name, enter a contract or write a will. Once she was widowed, she gained some of these rights back. We can get an idea of how Mary lived by comparing the probate record of Jacob Merrell when he died in 1771 with Mary’s inventory when she died in 1792. Upon a husband’s death, wives received one-third of their husband’s wealth, called the “dower’s share.” The most valuable “movables” Mary received were a feather bed bolster, a year old heifer, curtains, a blanket, and six silver teaspoons. Each of these items was worth more than a case with drawer (a blanket chest with one drawer). She also acquired a bed, two pillows and two blankets. For her third of the farm, she got a one-year-old heifer. She also received one-third of the real estate of land and house. The probate records described specifically what parts of the house legally belonged to her. Along with getting the South Lower Room, she also got the “liberty to use the fire place in the North Room for washing and baking and to pass and repass thro’ the entry North Room and Kitchen to the well.” She also got the west end of the barn and the liberty to use the barn floor for carting in hay and threshing and feeding the cattle. Her oldest son Jacob, who was 13 at the time, owned the other two-thirds of the estate. What would it have been like for a grown woman to have to depend so heavily on her 13-year-old son? Mary’s inventory on her death 21 years later provides a window on how she survived for those years without a husband. She kept many of the movable goods she received in 1771 and she added a large number of goods showing that, though she may not have prospered, her standard of living probably did not decline noticeably. By the time of her death, when she was in her late 50s, she had items that reflected economic production, furniture and clothing, and items that went beyond the necessities. There was clearly economic production in her house. Mary had a churn, Dutch wheel, and two hetchels for preparing flax to spin into linen. She had a few hogsheads and two meat barrels in which to store her food. She had one pig, two cows, and one steer. She had a right to the horse house and she owned 36 acres of land in her own right. She also had two hives of bees, which aside from her animals and land, were her most valuable property. Perhaps she got these hives during the Revolutionary War when West Division families chose to stop importing British traded sugar. She had about the same amount of furniture, and had added blankets, quilts, another bed and several sheets. She had many more kitchen tools including a porridge pot, teapot, large basin, brass kettle, large iron kettle and a washtub. Her ownership of a clock, two “best” tablecloths, five teaspoons, five napkins, and two pictures show the growing gentility of the age. The standard of living for all New Englanders improved over these twenty years, and Mary’s ability to buy or produce these items shows that she was able to improve her standard of living. Her children were in their 20s and 30s by time she died. Some of them must have stayed to help her or lived nearby. Mary had enough money to pay her funeral expenses which included, in order of value, a gravestone, money for the distributors, two quarts of gin, money for the surveyor, money for the advertisements, money for “time and trouble”, one quart of rum, and a horse and wagon. Widowed farm women had to live with others to survive, and Mary Merrell had her children. She could continue to run the household and, in Mary’s case, her honey might have given her some extra buying power. Women could choose not to remarry, but my guess is that Mary’s 21 years of widowhood would have been remarkable in small town New England. Old Lights and New Lights Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, October 2003 In 1977, local historian Elizabeth Hathaway wrote a “Chronology of some of the events that might have been discussed by West Division families during Noah Webster’s youth.” In this four page chronology of the years 1757 to 1774, she notes two particular events about choosing a new minister and buying and settling land in the Susquehanna which tie the reader to colonial and international affairs, illustrating how learning the history of our town, then the West Division, can teach about national and international issues. Choosing a new minister was part of a web of larger events. The issues of fate, salvation, the role of the sermon, the role of emotions and good works were all part of the decision about who to choose as the next pastor. In 1759, Benjamin Colton, the first minister in the West Division, died. He served the town for 46 years and baptized Noah Webster, Jr. Colton trained to be a Congregational minister at Yale, and so was ordained by other ministers, not by bishops. Pastors from surrounding towns, including the First Church in Hartford, ordained him. Colton held the beliefs of an Old Light minister, a man who supported the Puritan ideals of the colony’s founders. Old Lights had softened some of the strict rules of the church and the Halfway Covenant allowed more members into the church. The New Lights challenged the established Old Light clerical leadership who were trained at Yale. They emerged from the First Great Awakening in the 1740s. New Lights were considered more evangelical, and the sermon, which could move congregants emotionally, was more important than the reasoned sermons of the learned Old Light ministers. New Light ministers were not college educated, but were known for their ability to preach. The Hartford ministry liked the revivals at first. They felt they breathed new life into their congregations. Itinerant preachers like George Whitfield – an outsider, without a Yale education - preached in the area. As the New Lights gained followers, the Old Lights condemned them. Local Puritan ministers refused to approve New Lights for ordination. The Old Lights, like Benjamin Colton, supported the Presbyterian associations that were set up by the Saybrook Platform in 1708 which centralized the choosing of ministers to make sure that they were products of Yale and the traditional preaching of the Puritans. New Lights wanted each church to have congregational independence. They accused Old Lights of believing that people could control their salvation contrary to the belief that their fate was established at birth. (Anne Hutchinson was kicked out of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 1630s for this idea that people had some control of their fate.) The Old Lights denied this, but the accusations stuck. New Lights said that the Old Lights examined people’s’ lives, not their hearts. New Lights opposed the rational, more intellectual teachings of Old Lights. These New Light evangelical ministers allowed congregants into their churches without saving grace and attacked Old Light ministers for being spiritually dead. There must have been some discussion of these issues in the West Division upon Colton’s death in 1759. In that same year, there was an attempt to oust the Old Lights from control of the General Assembly which met in both Hartford and New Haven, but it was not successful. In 1759, the West Division congregation elected Nathanael Hooker, another Yale graduate, thus affirming the Old Light control of their church. But the New Light presence did not disappear. Just seven years later, in 1766, a parish member invited a New Light minister into the group and it was deemed a disorderly thing to do. The influence of the First Great Awakening had West Division residents thinking, but their allegiance remained with the Old Lights. A second issue which brought world issues to the West Division was Connecticut land claims in what had become Pennsylvania. The Connecticut Charter dating back to the 17th century claimed Connecticut’s land stretched from sea to sea. This led to overlapping claims with William Penn‘s charter, which most people agreed, superseded this charter. But, some people, especially in eastern Connecticut still believed they had jurisdiction over western Pennsylvania. The French also claimed some of this territory. People in the Connecticut colony started a land bank where people borrowed and deposited money. The deposited money earned interest, and people put up Susquehanna land as collateral for the money they borrowed. The land bank invested in the Susquehanna land company. Speculators in eastern Connecticut had done so for years. Noah Webster, Sr. subscribed to the land bank in 1754; he owned land there that would be bought by a settler. This land was disputed during the French and Indian War which endured from 1754 to 1761. When the war ended and the threat of the French and the Indians dissipated, settlement began in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. However, the Proclamation of 1763, part of the French and Indian War peace treaty, banned settlement in the Susquehanna land. Webster’s investment seemed to have lost his value. But, in 1769, Connecticut residents, in direct opposition to both Parliament and the Pennsylvania colony, once again settled in the Susquehanna. This settlement stirred up old tensions over Connecticut’s charter. Opponents of settlement, who tended to be Old Lights, felt settlement jeopardized Connecticut’s charter. They feared that this charter, which allowed for an elected Governor, not an appointed one by the Crown, would be in jeopardy if the settlers persisted. Connecticut was the only colony which did not have a Royal Governor, and the Old Light leaders believed Connecticut should lay low and not draw attention from Parliament in any way. After Parliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765, New Lights took the principled stand of proclaiming the tax as evil. They questioned the Parliament’s ability to lay an internal tax and used this issue to unseat the Old Light Governor Thomas Fitch. Fitch had written a pamphlet on the issue, but he had not opposed the Stamp Act strongly enough. William Pitkin, a New Light, won election and took control. Webster, Sr., aligned with the New Lights, while he lived in an Old Light town. Certainly there would have been those here who would have discouraged the speculation in Pennsylvania land. We can only guess whether Webster was making a political statement along with trying to make some money. We do know from Hathaway that Webster, Sr. was elected a grand jury man in 1760, and a selectman in 1768 and 1769, and from 1772 to 1774 he was elected Treasurer of the Ecclesiastical Society when Nathan Perkins, a Princeton graduate, became minister, upon Hooker’s death. In the 1760s, tensions abounded in the West Division. These religious, economic, and political tensions were often tied to national and international events. The beauty of local history is that it provides specific evidence, familiar to us, that helps shed light on these broader events and ideas. The local and national events can each gain deeper meaning when we can make those connections. Here Lies the Story of Elisha Seymour Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, November 2011 Elisha Seymour died at age 32 in October 20, 1776 of “the putrid fever” while serving in the West Division ’s militia to fight the British Revolutionary War. He left an inventory of his “reale and personal estate” which allows us a window into the world of revolutionary America. By carefully reading Seymour’s inventory one can discover what he did for a living and something about his position in the community. Noah Webster House researchers found Seymour ’s inventory in the Probate Records Collection at the Connecticut State Library. They searched through the Fourth Congregational Church records to find out how big his family was to try to recreate the texture of his life. Elisha married Rhoda Sedgwick on June 13, 1762 when he was just 18 years old. Their first son Elisha was baptized just seven months after they married, a sign that premarital sex is not new. Just 14 months later they had their second son. Rhoda and Elisha went on to have five more children, for a total of six boys - Elisha, Levi, Theron, Herman, Luther and Ambrose - and the last, a girl born in 1773 named Prudence. When their father died in the war, their children were ages 2 to 13. Seymour’s fighting in the Revolutionary War may have led to our independence, but what did it mean for Rhoda and her seven children? We don’t know how soon she remarried, but it would have been most difficult for her to survive on her own. At age 13, it would have been difficult, but possible, for son Elisha to act as head of household. Seymour’s inventory was used to appraise the total value of his estate so that his debts could be settled and his belongings could be fairly distributed to his heirs. The colonial court appointed appraisers, usually neighbors, to conduct inventories. For Seymour, Daniel Webster (Noah Webster’s uncle) and Noah Webster Sr. appraised the property. Solomon Ensign and Benjamin Gilbert appraised a few more items that were tacked on to the end of the inventory, completed almost a year after his death on October 16, 1777. Usually, the wife received one-third of the estate and the sons got the other two-thirds. Seymour’s entire estate was worth 257 pounds, 6 shillings and 10 pence. He owned land, but probably not enough to be a farmer. He owned a house, three acres of land and a barn worth 140 pounds. This made up about 55 percent of the worth of his estate. He also owned eight acres of woodland worth 33 pounds, about four pounds per acre. In the 1770s in New England, a middling farmer needed about 50 acres to make a go of it. Seymour owned a yoke of oxen (10 pounds) and four cows (10 pounds) that provided him with a means for transportation and milk. He owned one draft chain and a narrow axe. He also owned a “chair carriage,” which likely was pulled by his team of oxen. He owned seven stock sheep and two swine. He had two bushels of flaxseed in his inventory as well. Flax was used to make linen cloth. Clearly, Seymour did not have enough land to make it as a farmer. Further down in his inventory, a set of shoemaker tools and a pair of boots is listed. He owned a shoemaker’s candlestick as well. So, he would have had a farm, but would have made a living as a shoemaker. To process the wool and flax, Seymour owned two wool cards, a great wheel and a Dutch wheel for spinning. Cloth manufacturing was going on in his home, probably by Rhoda and the children. In the kitchen, his household had a new corn basket and a frying pan. He had three old cider barrels and two hogsheads. He had a pepper mill, an old brass kettle, a box iron and heater, old knives and forks, a shovel and tongs, a pair of hand irons, a great trammel and a small, both installed in the fireplace. He had two powdering tubs, three bottles, one stone jar, one coffee copper pot, a tea kettle and an iron pot. He had two great platters, five pewter plates, two pewter basins, a pewter teapot, three glasses, a china cup, a warming tan and a punch bowl. The poor used wooden utensils, so the existence of pewter objects shows that Seymour did have the ability to show signs of gentility. Pewter cost about one-tenth of the price of silver, but still the cost of a dish equaled what a skilled craftsman could earn in a day. More than 300 pounds of pewter were shipped to the American colonies annually in the 1760s. He also had eight earthen plates made by the local potter. He had a hand-held looking glass. There was a glass decanter and a glass cruet for vinegar. Seymour had an iron kettle and iron shovel for the fire, a pair of flat irons, which may have been manufactured in western Connecticut where an iron foundry was established in the early 1700s, despite British policy that no manufacturing could be done in the colonies. In colonial homes, rooms had many different functions: Homeowners moved their furniture around daily. The best room where guests visited would also be the parental bedroom. Seymour owned two chairs, two feather beds and a second bedstead. a trundle bed and a bed quilt. He had three pillows and two pillowcases. He also possessed woolen sheets. These woolen sheets could be a sign that Seymour bought locally woven woolen cloth. Cotton cloth was manufactured at this time in England, but Patriots like Seymour would have chosen not to import such materials during this time period. He also owned linen sheets. Flax plants were grown right west of Webster ’s house down the hill in what is now Rockledge Golf Course. The two bushels of flax seed in his inventory point to home manufacturing of these sheets. Before the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, flax literally sustained people in colonial America. It was grown in every colony. It was not only used for its fiber to make cloth. Fiber also was used for its linseed oil. Seymour’s ownership of a tablecloth and curtains were a sign of the increased ability to produce cloth and the sign of a growth in consumerism. Clothing was a valuable part of anyone’s estate in the late 1700s. Seymour had four coats, four vests, one pair of leather breeches and one pair of knit breeches. He had three pair of stockings, a new checked linen shirt , two plain shirts, a yard and a half of cloth, six pair of trousers, a silk handkerchief, a pair of gloves, a pair of shoes, a pair of shoe buckles and a pair of knee buckles. He stored his clothing in a chest of drawers and a white chest. Seymour owned a gun and two powder horns. It is notable that he left a gun at home, because he probably had one with him while serving in the militia. Seymour also owned two Bibles. He had a mariner’s calendar, a book called the Young Man’s Companion and an Old Mariner book. The shoemaker was both literate and religious. Finally, he had a “note against Joseph Waters” worth 4 pounds 16 pence, 7 shillings. This note made him a lender, not a debtor. Seymour made a living at one of the most commonly practiced trades in colonial New England. Because it was so easy to set up shop, the competition could be fierce and by the late 18th century, ready-made shoes from England were part of the competition. With non-importation that came with the American Revolution, this could have helped him financially. Instead, he chose to go off to war. Perhaps young Elisha had taken up the trade by that time. My guess is that family and maybe even the town had to step in to help Rhoda as she managed her household of eight without her husband. Textiles in Early West Hartford Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, February 2002 Go see Lucy Young’s tablecloth and towel in the Noah Webster House’s exhibit “Textiles 2001.” The tablecloth is an “M’s and O’s” pattern made of natural linen. It is 23.5 inches wide and uses three panels of cloth. Woven sometime between 1775 and 1820, it has a hand netted fringe similar to fishnet attached on all four sides. Lucy Young signed her name to this tablecloth. Lucy Young demonstrates her skill weaving natural linen using the “M’s and O’s” pattern. The fringe on the tablecloth denotes a sense of gentility in a growing consumer culture. It also represents women’s role in an economy based on work by both men and women. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. You can also see a towel, known then as a “point twill diamond diaper” with a cotton tab on each end. This, too, was woven between 1775 and 1820 and belonged to Young. These pieces of woven cloth are beautiful to look at, and represent so much of the change and tension of life in a small town in Connecticut at the time of the new nation. I happened to view these two textiles, among the 30 on display in the exhibit, while I was in the middle of reading Laurel Thatcher Ulrich’s new book, The Age of Homespun: Objects and Stories in the Creation of an American Myth (2001). Ulrich argues that textiles, as much as farming, were the center of the economy of the new republic in New England. When you find out how linen cloth was made, you get an idea of the interdependence of men and women and a feeling of the rising sense of gentility in places where people had been living for almost 100 years. Ulrich, a Harvard history professor, uses a linen tablecloth from New Hampshire, very similar to the Lucy Young’s, as an example of household production. She argues that the edgings, tassels and fringes were a sign of “emerging neoclassicism and the spread of rural refinement.” She spends a chapter showing how this tablecloth reflects New England’s industrial beginnings, not as a radical departure from home production, but as an adaptation to what they already knew. She describes the interdependence of men and women in household production. When we think about Lucy Young’s tablecloth within Ulrich’s interpretation, it gives us a new window on life in the West Division. Local historians believe that flax was grown west of the Webster house, in what are now Rockledge Golf Course and the neighborhood that surrounds Duffy School. Daniel Webster, grandfather to Noah, had a loom in his house. His inventory in 1766 listed one peck of flaxseed worth 1 shilling 3 pence, and 7 pounds of flax worth 6 pence. Flax was planted in May by farmers who sowed the seed by broadcasting it. The seeds were light, but it was difficult to seed evenly. To plant a half an acre, farmers needed ¾ of a bushel of seed. In June, women often weeded the flax. Three or four days of harvest in late July or early August meant pulling the flax plants up by its roots, being careful not to tangle the stems. New Englanders let the plants grow long enough to produce seeds and the next step was to remove the seeds from the stem to save them for the next planting. Ulrich reports that in one Connecticut town, merchants exported more than 4,000 bushels of flaxseed in one year. West Division farmers probably produced only for local consumption. Daniel Webster’s flax seed was probably from last year’s crop. The next step was to “ret” the flax to get the hard outer stem off the silky fibers. Interpreters at the Noah Webster house believe that this was done in the brook, which today flows through the golf course and then runs through a pipe under the Conard High School Athletic fields. Ulrich believes that many New Englanders retted flax in the fall by placing the flax on the grass where it would soak up the dew, until the outer shell broke down. Whichever method was used, it smelled terribly. If you go up to the garret in the Noah Webster house you will see the tools used for the rest of the process. A “braking” machine swings a heavy plank onto a small bundle of flax and then a small paddle was used to separate the husk that remained. The short fibers called “tow” fell to the ground. Either women or men could have done this task. The husk was saved as tinder to start a fire; processing flax was often dangerous because of its flammability. Hetcheling was women’s work and could be dangerous. Hetchels consist of a square of wood with an array of nails through which one draws the flax to prepare it for spinning. The Noah Webster House has three different sizes. Spinning was a big part of women’s work in the early republic. Women spun alone and they spun in groups. They spun flax and wool. And they spun day after day. Even as people were able to buy machine-made cloth from England, and as the industrial revolution began in New England, they continued to weave and spin. The consumer society, which we so easily recognize today, had begun. People had more textiles in their homes in the form of clothing, bed and table linens. But the home production continued. When 100 years earlier, a man might have two shirts; by 1800 he could have five. In Connecticut, certain portions of the textile making were taken out of the home. By 1800, almost every town, including the West Division, had a carding mill. One was on Trout Brook in what is now Beachland Park, just north of the pond. No longer did women need to do the time-consuming job of carding the wool. People took their wool to the carding mill and it did this work very quickly. Then women had more time to spin. This did not mean that families got rid of their cards. Some total home production continued. In the 1759 inventory of the West Division’s Thomas Olmsted, one pair of cards is listed along with 15 ½ pounds of wool. Inventories of Jacob Merrel (1770), shows him owning a weavers’ loom, a winding wheel, three shuttles and one hetchel. Allyn Seymour (1760) had a Little Wheel, a Dutch Wheel, linen yarn and worsted yarn. Ebeneezer Mix (1766) had 32 pounds of wool, some wool colored blue, a Dutch wheel, clock reel, hetchel and 34 weight of flax in his garret. Mehitable Bidwell’s inventory (1767) shows the cooperative nature of the world 200 years ago. The inventory shows 1/3 of a hetchel, demonstrating that Bidwell had to share. Ulrich argues that ownership and cloth making were often community affairs. The existence of Lucy Young’s table cloth, which is homespun, also tells of a new sense of gentility and the possibility of having more than what was necessary, another sign of the growing consumer culture. It is not until the 1770s that tablecloths begin to appear in inventories. By this time, people have the time and means to make what are not necessities. Allyn Seymours inventory (1760) lists two tablecloths, Ebeneezer Mix’s (1766) two diaper tablecloths, a fringe tablecloth, a birdseye table cloth, and a plain and a diamond tablecloth. Ebeneezer Sedgwick (1760) had a diaper tablecloth, two tablecloths, six diaper napkins, and four homemade diaper napkins. In this case, the distinction is made between machine bought and homespun. These inventories and Lucy Young’s textiles remind us that men’s and women’s economic lives were interdependent. The household remained a site of production even as the industrial revolution began to move some production outside the home. This Industrial Revolution was not a sudden dislocation, but a slow process that was blended into the family economy providing more consumer choice and a higher standard of living. West Hartford Center Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, August 2009 West Hartford Center’s vibrant mix of commercial, residential, religious, office and public buildings attracts many people each day. Even back in the 1770s, according to Elizabeth C. Hathaway, a local historian and researcher for the Noah Webster House in the 1970s, the town center from the Old Burial Ground south to Sedgwick/Park Road consisted of commercial, residential, religious, educational and public land. John Pantry originally owned West Hartford’s Center in the late 17th century, according to Hathaway in her unpublished article ”A look at West Hartford in 1776.” In many New England villages, the proprietors made small house lots near a center meeting house but in the West Division, the land was divided in long lots from Mountain Road to Quaker Lane before there was a meetinghouse. In the late 1670s, when the land was divided, the proprietors expected that the residents would attend church in Hartford. It wasn’t until 1711 that the General Court allowed for a meetinghouse to be built in the West Division, and according to Hathaway, this is when the “center” began to take on an identity. In the 1710s, the Ecclesiastical Society, the name by which the Congregational Church was known, bought land from John Janes north of the meetinghouse to establish a burial ground. According to the deed, Janes kept his animals there but had to maintain the fence around the land Soon after the burial ground was established, the Brace family bought land abutting the burial ground. Probate records show that family members were paid to dig graves. The Brace family built the second mill in the West Division in the 1720s, right north of where Farmington Avenue crosses Trout Brook. If you walk in the Old Burial Ground, you can still see the lane that led from Main Street down to their mill. Sons of the first Brace mill owner, Zenas and Henry, operated the gristmill and lived on opposite sides of Main Street just south of the Old Burial Ground. Citizens built the one room schoolhouse just south of the mill lane on the east side of Main Street. Dr. Caleb Perkins lived across from the schoolhouse, and just north of the meetinghouse. He was a cousin of the Reverend Nathan Perkins. By 1742, when the meeting house became too small for the increased population, Timothy Goodman granted land to the Ecclesiastical Society on which to build a larger meeting house. Goodman married a Pantry daughter and he gained ownership of the western section of land as part of her dowry. Goodman also granted land to the Ecclesiastical Society “for a place of parade forever.” Local men in the town’s militia trained at what today we call Goodman Green. Though the size and shape of the Green has changed in the last 265 years, it is still owned by the First Church of Christ Congregational and leased to the town for $1 per year. The Ecclesiastical Society chose Reverend Nathan Perkins to be minister in 1772 after the Reverend Nathaniel Hooker died at age 30. Perkins served the church for 66 years. He purchased Hooker’s house on the east side of South Main Street and it remained the parsonage and stood until the 1930s when the new library and new Town Hall were built. Perkins tutored young men who had finished at the one room schoolhouse and wanted to attend Yale. The Butler family owned land south of Hooker’s parsonage. Descendants of Joseph Butler lived on both sides of Main Street. John Whitman’s account book records the Butler family producing barrels, pails, wheels and plows on the land probably at the location of the Crate and Barrel and Radioshack today. South of the Butlers, probably where the Town Hall is today, was the land of Abijah Colton, the son of the first pastor. He lived in his father’s house. John Belden lived across the road and lived in what people in 1738 perceived of as “mansion home.” Belden also owned land west of Mountain Road on land that was then part of Farmington. He owned a share of a sawmill. The Olmstead family owned the next pieces of land on the westside of South Main Street reaching to a point just north of Sedgwick Road. They were descendants of Nicholas Olmsted, one of the original landowners in town. His son Thomas inherited the land in 1683 and was the first member of the family to settle in town. In 1776, Thomas’s sons, Stephen (age 82), and Daniel (age 75) and his grandson Timothy and great grandson Nathaniel Steel, Jr. all had homes on the original property. Stephen had been a blacksmith and Nathaniel was a shoemaker. The land stayed in the family until the 1880s. Ebenezer Crosby, Samuel Sedgwick, and Stephen Hopkins owned the land at the intersection of Sedgwick and South Main. On the northwest corner where the SNET building is today, Ebenezer Crosby ran his blacksmith shop. On the southwest corner, Samuel Sedgwick had his farm and his tavern. In 1714, he got a license “to give public entertainment for victuals and drink to sell at his house to people who come for ordination of their minister.” By 1731 his license included the “retail of strong drink and keep a house of public entertainment of strangers.” This is probably the site of the first tavern in the West Division. Just to the west of this site, the Sedgwicks sold a piece of their land to the heirs of Reverend Colton. They built the colonial home which still stands today on the corner of Sedgwick and Ridgebrook Roads. On the east side of South Main at Sedgwick, Samuel Sedgwick’s great grandson lived on part of the original farm and continued the weaving shop that had been there for two generations. He built another house and a tanyard that he worked into the 1800s. A tanyard was the part of a tannery that had the tanning vats to process cowhides into leather. West Hartford’s town center in 1776 had mixed use. The third and fourth generations of the original owners had divided and subdivided the land, many carrying on the economic use of their elders. Weaving, tanning, shoemaking, blacksmithing, preaching, tavern keeping combined with farming provided for a lively town center. Today, with West Hartford Center’s post office building on the list to close to save the federal government money in these tough economic times, it reminds me just how fluid the ownership of land in the center has been. While residents lament a loss of convenience, and a walkable service, and sign petitions to keep the small, but handy post office, both the federal government, and some local elected officials and developers yearn to develop this prime spot of land in the town’s center. Bristow: A man who bridged cultures, and bought his way to freedom Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, November 2004 Bristow, an enslaved African aged 44, bought his freedom from Thomas Hart Hooker in 1775. Imagine the human dynamics of this manumission transaction. His manumission paper, in the Connecticut Historical Society, approximately 18 centimeters in length and of paper yellow with age reads: Know all men by these presents that I Thomas Hart Hooker of Hartford in the County of Hartford for the consideration of Sixty Pounds money Rec’d to my full satisfaction – do by these present fully freely and absolutely release manumit and set at full Liberty a Certain Negro man Named Bristow from (?) to my house &amp; assigns forever and I Do Grant to him said Bristow his full Liberty and Freedom from me and my Service that he may go &amp; come when &amp; wherever he pleases without any Hindrance or molestation from me or any one claiming from by or under me. In Witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand seal the 9th day of May Anno Dom 1775 in the 16th year of his Majesty’s Reign. Signed, Sealed &amp; Deli’v In presence of Thomas Hart Hooker Salmon Whitman Mary Root Did Bristow know what freedom was while enslaved? Did he understand it once he had his freedom? His manumission paper clearly states what freedom included: Being at full liberty from Hooker’s house forever Having freedom from service to Hooker Going and coming when and wherever he pleased without any hindrance or molestation from Hooker or anyone claiming to be working for Hooker When I study slavery with my students, I often ask if they think enslaved people can understand freedom. Some students argue that not having freedom allows a person to understand the concept better. Others say that if a person can see his/her master’s freedom, s/he can know what it is. Still others argue that a person can only know what freedom is when they have it. Thomas Hart Hooker, the owner of Bristow, was 30 years old in 1775 at the time of Bristow’s emancipation. He was the great-grandson of Thomas Hooker, the first English settler in Hartford. Thomas Hart Hooker married Sarah Whitman Hooker six years earlier in 1769 and they had two children, Abigail, born in 1770 and Thomas Hart Hooker Jr. born in 1772. At a point in time before 1775, Bristow had come to be the property of Hooker. This was not an unusual event in the West Division of Hartford. The pastors, Benjamin Colton (1713-1759) and Nathanael Hooker (1759-1770) each owned slaves. Africans who were enslaved were present in both Hartford and the West Division and most likely it was the economic and political leaders of the day who owned these Africans and their descendants who were often referred to as “servants.” In December 1774, many colonists agreed to stop the importation, exportation and consumption of British goods. But even after the first battle of the war at Lexington and Concord April 19, 1775, most Americans believed that the British would change their ways. They remained loyal to England and thought that the Parliament would treat the colonists more fairly. Hooker enlisted in the Hartford militia as a private soldier at “first call” in 1775. His wife, two children and maybe some other “Negro” servants were left home, but Bristow would have been free. With a wife and two children aged five and three, Hooker went off not more than a month after the battles at Lexington and Concord. Thomas Hart Hooker was killed in the siege of Boston and died on November 11, 1775. His body lies in an unmarked grave in Roxbury. Hooker’s genealogy says that “before going to the seat of war he gave freedom to his negro servants saying that he would not own property in a human being while he, himself, was fighting for freedom.” The lore about Bristow was that Hooker bestowed freedom upon his “negro servants.” Bristow’s manumission paper reveals a story of Bristow’s freedom that directly challenges Hooker’s genealogy. What makes Bristow’s manumission document so significant? What surprises me the most was Bristow’s ability to buy his own freedom. He earned 60 pounds to pay Hooker. This was a large sum of money, especially for someone who was enslaved. One day’s work was worth three shillings, according to account books from the time period. At 20 shillings per pound, Bristow paid 1,200 shillings or the equivalent of 400 eight-hour days of work. (At minimum wage in 2004 that would be close to $25,000.) This document is also significant for its use of “republican discourse” which had crept into American political and social life since the mid-18th century years. This was rhetoric different from that of England. The colonists established new norms for behavior in America. The use of the terms “set at full liberty and freedom” are the very words used by the revolutionaries of the day. The two witnesses to this transaction, Salmon Whitman (perhaps a relative to Sarah Whitman Hooker) and Mary Root witnessed this economic transaction when Bristow paid his sum of money to his master. Women had few political rights, and yet Mary Root was allowed to be a legitimate witness for the transaction. According to law, Hooker could not manumit Bristow unless Bristow could take care of himself. It seems, from reading Bristow’s will from 1791 (16 years later), that Bristow then went to work for Thomas Hart Hooker’s brother, Roger. Roger, according to the Hooker genealogy, was born in 1751, and was six years younger than his brother. He made 11 voyages to the West Indies before the Revolutionary War. What did the colonists trade with the West Indies? A profitable commodity was Africans. Historians have claimed that enslaved people in New England were treated as part of the family and were treated better than their counterparts in the South. Numerous runaway ads in the Connecticut Courant and a number of manumissions give us evidence that this was certainly not true for all. But Bristow’s will shows him bequeathing “all my estate both real and personal unto Thomas Hart Hooker and Abigail Hooker, children of Thomas Hart Hooker late of Hartford.” This new gravestone was added to the Old Burial Ground in 2004 when the original (now at Bristow Middle School) broke off at the ground level. His name was spelled variously as Bristow, Bristol, Bristoll and Bristo. This site, in the northwest corner of the cemetery, is a part of Connecticut’s African American Freedom Trail. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. Imagine Bristow’s decision. Terry Schmitt, Board of Education member, suggested that Bristow was a man who could bridge cultures and that was why Schmitt said he voted to name the new middle school after him. Bristow was an African-American who, after buying his freedom, continued to respect and be respected by the children of his master. That could only have happened if this was a two-way relationship from a man who knew what it meant to be free and be human. Putting the Pieces of an African-American Life Together Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, February 2006 The Noah Webster House’s newest exhibit, “Bristow: Putting the Pieces of an African-American Life Together,” opens February 28. The exhibit is the culmination of a year’s worth of research, collecting artifacts and puzzling out the mysteries of Bristow. Come visit, read, see, and feel Bristow’s experiences in the context of an 18th century home. Noah Webster House Executive Director Chris Dobbs, explains that one of the challenges for public historians is to catch the emotions of their audience. He argues that reading about the past and seeing pictures can pique curiosity, and once the emotions are stirred, people’s memory is enhanced. Mr. Dobbs wants this exhibit to be a visceral experience that draws visitors to the house. You can sit on a bench and see images of a British slave ship carrying African captives. You’ll be below deck with a hatch above you. You can hold the shackles for the below-deck scene of the middle passage. A blacksmith from Mystic Seaport reproduced the type of shackles that would have been found aboard a ship in the mid-1700s. These shackles linked the captive to the person on either side through a horseshoe and rod, and were chained to a place on board the ship with a lock holding the individuals together. Captives were riveted together and only a blacksmith could undo them. Even feeling the weight of the shackles gives some sense of the agony of the middle passage. Some time after Bristow arrived in the West Division of Hartford, he was acquired by Thomas and Sarah Whitman Hooker. Sarah was the daughter of John Whitman, a slave holder. Might Whitman have given Bristow as a gift to the newly married couple in 1769? We don’t know the answer. We do know that at age 43, in 1775, Bristow bought his freedom for 60 pounds as Thomas Hart Hooker made his way to Massachusetts to fight in the American Revolution. Imagine an enslaved man earning what was the equivalent of $9,500 today, working in his spare time on farms beyond that of the Hooker’s. In the exhibit, you can view a copy of Bristow’s manumission papers from the Connecticut Historical Society. Those who visit the exhibit will be able to fill out a copy of a manumission paper to document their own freedom. Imagine the value of that paper for free African-Americans who lived in a tenuous state of semi-freedom in New England. An interactive flip panel will help participants understand the limitations of freedom for those freed by the gradual emancipation law in 1784 or by buying their freedom. Unlike most African-Americans in the late 18th century, Bristow had economic success. He bought three acres of land and a grist mill in 1788 in Bristol. The exhibit will display a copy of the land deed. He bought these properties for “the consideration of 140 pounds lawful money,” more than double the cost of his freedom. Bristow sold the land for 85 pounds four years later, at a substantial loss. A map in the exhibit shows where the grist mills in Bristol were in the 1790s. While Bristow owned the land he wrote a will, something unusual for an African-Americans in the 18th century. He bequeathed his property to his former owner Sarah Whitman Hooker’s children; they were 21 and 17 at the time the will was written. By the time Bristow died in 1814, his estate was worth $600. You can see a copy of his real will, which is held at the Connecticut State Library. These historical documents will be set against three original pieces of art by Brian Colbath, an accomplished West Hartford artist. One painting is a collage of the major events in Bristow’s life. The painting will be in the exhibit, scanned and printed onto magnets, so that those who visit the exhibit can piece together Bristow’s life on a magnet board. The second work is a five-by-six-foot painting of the Sarah Whitman Hooker House, which will be the backdrop for Bristow’s and the West Division’s main economic activity, farming. A real wood and iron plow from the 1790s will be displayed here. In the late 1800s, in a memoir of early West Hartford, Bristow was hailed for his agricultural expertise. The third mural is of a liberty tree, an elm planted at the Sarah Whitman Hooker House. Elm trees were planted as liberty trees in the 1770s as a symbol of the American Revolution; the first elm named a liberty tree was in Boston, where an effigy of Massachusetts Gov. Thomas Hutchinson was hung in reaction to his enforcement of the Stamp Act. All along the street in Elmwood, citizens planted elms which gave that section of town its name. There is evidence that either Amboy or Bristow planted the elm at Sarah Whitman Hooker’s House. Those who view the exhibit can imagine the strength and symbolism of these trees. The exhibit is part of a series of events during February and March 2006 that will highlight the role of African-Americans during Bristow’s lifetime. On February 12, West Hartford native Jenifer Frank will discuss her book, Complicity. On March 9, this author will lead participants through a series of primary documents that tell the story of African-Americans in the 18th century West Division. The exhibit will remain at the Noah Webster House for about six months and then will travel to Bristow Middle School as a permanent exhibit. History museums are one of the prime ways that Americans learn history. Museum exhibits often provide a way into the past not offered by books or television or the big screen. Be part of the growing number of Americans who learn and feel history at museums. Check out the Noah Webster House exhibit, beginning February 28. Rochambeau and the Revolutionary West Division Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, June 2005 The West Division was a vibrant farming community when le Comte de Rochambeau and his French army of about 5,000 men marched through in 1782. In May 2007, West Hartford commemorated his march by installing a marker at the Sarah Whitman Hooker House. This marker shows us how a war had far reaching effects on the homefront in our town. The Revolutionary War was over when Rochambeau marched through, but the effects of the seven-year war reverberated through the town’s economic and political life. Nathan Perkins was a young pastor in 1775 when he gave an impassioned sermon in which he delivered a scathing attack on British imperial policy as a threat to the New England way of life. He delivered his speech in a patriot hotbed. Most locals had voted to support non-importation of British goods and once the first shots were fired at Lexington, West Division men volunteered to fight. Out of a total of about 1,000 people in the West Division during the American Revolution, about 250 would have been adult males. Twenty-six men died, about 10% of the adult male population. These men had an average age of 33. Thomas Hart Hooker was the first West Division man to die in December 1775 after fighting in Boston. In 1778, members of the militia went to Ticonderoga and a Negro servant of John Whitman Jr., named Pent, died in the camp. The widows and families of those who died were forced to rely on each other to survive. The first turning point in the war came in 1777 at the Battle of Saratoga. British General John Burgoyne invaded upstate New York from Canada hoping to meet up with William Howe’s troops in New York to cut New England off from the other colonies. Burgoyne captured Ticonderoga. In October, Burgoyne surrendered to American troops at Saratoga. Howe’s troops never made it north. This was a big blow to the British and proved to be more than a military victory for the Americans. This victory led to the French making an alliance with the United States and sending about 6,000 troops to the United States to help in the war effort. Jean Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, le Comte de Rochambeau, led this group from France in 1780. When they landed in Rhode Island in July, they were quickly put to work. Rochambeau marched to Connecticut in May 1781 where he met with Washington in Wethersfield. His last visit in 1782 was the one commemorated in May 2007. In the West Division, citizens celebrated Burgoyne’s defeat and Ebeneezer Faxon organized the planting of elm saplings at the corner of Quaker Lane and New Britain Avenue (then South Road). The elm was a symbol of liberty in colonial New England. Patriots in Boston hung tax collectors in effigy from the elm Liberty Tree in Boston. Ebeneezer Faxon, a potter, celebrated the win over General Burgoyne in 1777 by planting elm trees on his front lawn and along what became New Britain Avenue. After the elms died in the 1940s and 1950s, the Elmwood community has funded the replanting of elms in Victory over Burgoyne Park, also known as Blanchfield Park. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. The town also participated in the war effort by providing land for a Revolutionary War Camp set up on Albany Avenue as early as 1776. Some of the original fireplaces remain. When soldiers stayed at the Revolutionary War Camp in 1779, townspeople benefited by supplying them with provisions. At least 50 West Hartford men supplied goods and services including coffins, medicine, milk, Indian meal, straw, wood, hay, horses to use to transport sick from Hartford to the West Division, Indian corn, turnips, mutton, vinegar, oats, horse feed, paper, and transportation. According to West Hartford’s first Town Historian Nelson Burr, West Hartford sheep supplied wool for blankets, which the people sold to army quartermasters at the campsite on Albany Avenue up Talcott Mountain. The potter, Ebenezer Faxon, supplied tow cloth, a mixture of wool and linen. The army bought cows for food for the soldiers. Aside from supplying the encampment, West Division families made money by supplying soldiers in the war. In 1777, 21 families provided blankets for the militia. Thirteen more families supplied beef cattle to the army between 1775 and 1777. Moses Goodman &amp; Co. ran a distillery one mile west of the West Hartford meeting house, probably not too far from present day Gin Still Lane. Moses was the son of Timothy Goodman who lived on Mountain Road. These distilled spirits were a boon to the men who marched through and those in camp. Even those not directly involved in provisioning the army were affected by the war. People had to sacrifice in their businesses for the war effort. In 1779, Ebenezer Faxon asked the General Assembly to let him purchase lead in Boston for his pottery business in exchange for three barrels of flour and a hogshead of Indian corn. He declared that his occupation was necessary for the town, but the General Assembly turned him down, deeming lead for the war effort more important than for his pottery. Governor Trumbull asked the West Division to house British and Loyalist prisoners from the battle at Fort Ticonderoga. The British prisoner of war Colonel Philip Skene was moved from Middletown to West Hartford when his African slave John Anderson, attempted to become Negro Governor of Connecticut. Connecticut officials believed that the British, through Skene’s slave, might encourage the Connecticut slaves to revolt against their masters, thus helping the British cause. Sarah Whitman Hooker House housed Skene on the corner of New Britain Avenue and South Main Street from July 26, 1775 until September 1776. It is probable that Hooker’s house had a tavern. Its previous owners, Timothy Seymour, held a license for a tavern starting in 1733. It is likely that Hooker’s house was a meeting place for political talk about the war as well as a place to rest, eat and drink. Though the fighting was far from the West Division, we were about halfway between New York and Boston and many armies marched through, along the street where the liberty elms were planted. What is now New Britain Avenue, but used to be called South Road, was an important military highway, according to Burr. Another French soldier, Marquis de Chastellux, who marched through in 1780 wrote in his journal that he noticed the “inhabitants engage in some industry in addition to their prosperous agriculture, some cloths and other woolen stuffs are manufactured here.” He went in a house in which they were weaving and dyeing cloth. It wasn’t until October 1782, a year after the British surrender at Yorktown, that Rochambeau marched back through the West Division with his men from Yorktown to Boston. It is thought that he may have stopped at Sarah Whitman Hooker’s house. By that time, her husband Thomas Hooker had died in the war, and she had remarried Seth Collins in 1779. Her children were 13 and 11. Though her slave Bristow had bought his freedom in 1775, Hooker still held Amboy as a slave. Sarah Whitman Hooker’s life during the revolution shows probably as much dislocation as any in the town. In 1775, Bristow bought his freedom from she and her husband. Her husband went off to war and died leaving her with a 6 and 4 year old. She ran a tavern during the war and held prisoners of war there. The French army marched by her house and probably stopped for provisions. But like many Americans, she was able to adjust, take advantage of her circumstances, and endure the political and economic turmoil. She remarried in 1779 and readjusted her life. Using her as an example, it is clear that social, economic and political life in this small town changed as dramatically as it ever did in a short period of time. Bring on the Elms Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, November 2007 On October 6, the Elmwood Business Association and the town planted a disease-resistant elm, with 12 more to follow, on the Elmwood green in the former parking lot of Talcott Junior High School. This tree planting has its seed back when the first elms were planted in 1777, giving this section of town its name. Symbols are significant to every community. For Elmwood and West Hartford, the recent planting of the elm symbolizes a love for liberty defined during the Revolutionary War, reconciliation with opponents and it reinforces the sense of community which Elmwood has had since the original elms were planted. First and foremost, the elm tree stands for liberty, harking back to its significant role in the Revolutionary War. The elm was a liberty tree, first getting its fame in Boston in 1765 as a symbol of resistance to tyranny. Tax collectors were hung in effigy from the Boston elm. In Connecticut, the oak tree from the Charter Oak story served as the symbol of liberty more often than the elm. But the important piece here is that Ebeneezer Faxon had to plant the trees; as you may know, there are oak trees everywhere in West Hartford. The elm was a special tree and Faxon’s action was noticed and helped bring an identity to the community. The specific trees planted in Elmwood hearken back to the Revolutionary War, commemorating the Patriot win at Saratoga over British Gen. John Burgoyne. This was no small battle. The British were 9,000 strong at this battle and they surrendered on October 6, exactly 230 years before the replanting. This battle secured the northern American states from further attacks out of Canada and prevented New England from being isolated from the rest of the colonies. Burgoyne’s force was made of 3,000 red-coated British, 3,900 German mercenaries and about 650 Canadians, Tories and Indians from Canada. This multinational force surrendered to a larger Patriot force under General Gates. But the treatment of the enemy seems unusual to us today. The demand for unconditional surrender was flatly turned down by Burgoyne, but eventually a treaty of convention was accepted as the British agreed to not surrender, but be taken as prisoners of war and be marched to Boston and returned to England on condition that they would not serve again in the war. On October 17, 1777, Burgoyne appeared before General Gates in his full ceremonial uniform and they greeted him with formal cordiality. About 6,000 men were surrendered to the Patriots. This common 18th century military practice, however, was not carried out. The Continental Congress refused to ratify the convention and the enlisted men were held in captive camps in New England, Virginia and Pennsylvania until the end of the war. It seems that Charles I, Duke of Brunswick, did not want the soldiers back in England. He believed their presence would hurt recruitment for the duration of the war. Many of the British soldiers were housed by local patriots and ended up becoming Americans. Burgoyne and Gates, as the story goes, had a cordial dinner party after the battle, with Burgoyne toasting George Washington and Gates replying with King George III. Frederica de Riedesel, the wife of a German mercenary and the daughter of the Prussian minister of state, was 31 when she witnessed the dinner party in the fall of 1777. She wrote a journal, published in 1801, in which she recorded the events: We reached Albany, where we had so often wished ourselves; but did not enter that city, as we had hoped, with a victorious army. Our reception, however, from General Schuyler, and his wife and daughters, was not like the reception of enemies, but of the most intimate friends. They loaded us with kindness and they behaved in the same manner towards General Burgoyne, though he had without any necessity ordered their splendid establishment to be burnt All their actions proved that at the sight of the misfortunes of others, they quickly forgot their own. Burgoyne was so much affected by this generous deportment, that he said to Schuyler you are too kind to me who have done you so much injury. Such is the fate of war, he replied; let us not dwell on this subject. We remained three days with that excellent family and they seemed to regret our departure. This scene, describing the reconciling of enemies, reminds us of the importance of the results of battle. How are we to live together when the war is over if we objectify the enemy? This treatment of prisoners of war was not unusual during the Revolution. In the West Division of Hartford, Sarah Whitman Hooker held prisoner of war Philip Skene during the war. On July 26, 1775, Ethan Allen sent him and his slave to Hartford after the capture of Fort Ticonderoga. It seems Hooker also held dinner parties in her home for the prisoner of war. Coming face to face with the opposition humanized the enemy right here, as it did in Albany. It is thought that Hooker’s freed man Bristow planted an elm on the front lawn of their New Britain Avenue home. The Burgoyne elms helped to establish a sense of community in the southeastern section of town. They were planted in the West Division while Skene was held as prisoner of war. The elms helped to define a part of Hartford separate from the West Division, leading to the name Elmwood. This sense of community and love of liberty remain today. But the lesson of reconciling with our enemy takes even more strength to develop and is a more difficult lesson to practice. Elmwood’s Elm Trees Stand as a Powerful Symbol of Liberty Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, November 2008 The Elmwood section of West Hartford has had a long tradition of planting elms. On October 4, Duffy Cub Scout Pack 161 planted a Liberty Elm at Burgoyne Park as part of Elmwood’s project to “reclaim Elmwood.” The planting of this elm represents a positive good for the environment, a community activity and a way to connect with a past that defined and redefined liberty. In New England, elm trees are a symbol of individual liberty and of resistance to tyranny. In 1777 the first elms were planted and when this section of town got the name Elmwood, the area was still part of the city of Hartford. In Connecticut, because of the Charter Oak incident, many think of the oak as the tree of liberty, but in Elmwood, the idea of the liberty elm endures. In mid-October 1777, American troops defeated British General Johnny Burgoyne at Saratoga, New York, at what scholars call a turning point in the American Revolution. To celebrate, Capt. Ebenezer Faxon and his friends planted a small grove of 13 elms, one for each colony, at New Britain Avenue (then called South Street) and South Quaker Lane (then called East Street) as a lasting monument to Burgoyne’s defeat. Faxon was the founder of the Elmwood pottery and his homestead was on the northeast corner of the intersection. As the elm saplings grew, they became a town landmark known as the Burgoyne Elms. The history of the elm as a liberty tree began in 1765 as a protest against the British-imposed Stamp Act. That protest showed support for individual liberty and resistance to tyranny. The story of the first liberty tree, an elm tree, began in Boston on August 14, 1765. As farmers streamed into Boston for market day, they walked along a line of elm trees in front of Deacon Jacob Elliot’s house. As they looked up, they saw a body hanging from a branch. It was an effigy marked with the initials A.O. – Andrew Oliver. He was a Boston merchant who had agreed to collect the new Stamp Tax levied on the colonies. During that summer day, the size of the crowd around the tree grew. Public officials felt they needed to control the crowd. The sheriff ordered the effigy to be chopped down, but his deputies said they would be in danger of their lives if they did so. The effigy was hung by a Boston group called the Loyal Nine, men who were avowed Whigs who detested tyranny. The Nine were men of property and standing who became the core of the Sons of Liberty. When the Nine discussed their protest the previous night, they knew economic times were not good. The colonies were caught in a world depression. The British Parliament imposed a new stamp tax without their consent and they believed they could not afford it. Every member of the Loyal Nine was directly threatened by the tax. The printer had to put a tax on every issue of a newspaper and on advertisements; artisans and merchants had to pay taxes on each contract, indenture, and bill of sale. Distillers and attorneys had to pay a tax on licenses, and citizens had to pay taxes on school diplomas and militia commissions. Clearly the British Parliament believed the American colonies had too many newspapers, schools, attorneys, and liberties. To the Loyal Nine, the elm tree symbolized access to information, access to an education, rule by law, and individual liberty. In the early 1800s, it is thought that Bristow, the African man who was owned by the Hooker family, planted a Liberty elm on the lawn of the house the Hookers owned. A photograph from the late 1800s shows the mature tree with a caption saying that the tree was planted by a slave of the Hookers. I wonder if Bristow planted that tree before or after he bought his freedom. By the late 1800s, the traffic on Quaker Lane increased. I think that a line of elms served as a median strip for the two lanes of traffic. People used the road to get to the Beach creamery north of New Britain Avenue. In 1926, more elms were added to Elmwood when the state Highway Department awarded a contract to plant 85 American elms along New Britain Avenue from Hartford through Elmwood to New Britain. Many elms were killed in the 1940s and 1950s by Dutch Elm Disease, but that was not the only way that Elmwood lost its elms. In 1957, with the opening of Elmwood Plaza, Quaker Lane had to be widened again and 22 elms that formed the island known as Victory over Burgoyne Green were chopped down and replaced with a triangular green made of asphalt with a flagpole. In 1957, the spirit of progress overtook the ideals of liberty. A Hartford Courant reporter wrote, “the passing of Burgoyne Green is just another price that must be paid for progress. Along with the green went 22 large trees along the avenue that had been the pride of the Elmwood community for hundreds of years.” By re-elming Elmwood, today’s citizens make a connection with the past that symbolizes a belief in access to information, education, rule by law and individual liberty, all ideals shared by the West Hartford community. Drive by Burgoyne Park and take a look at the two elms planted there. These trees will grow just like the stately elms that lined New Britain Avenue. The enlarged park abuts the new Quaker Green condominiums and provides more space that the previous park bench and flag pole that were squeezed onto the corner. Now, a former asphalt parking lot has been greened and “elmed.” Note: On October 30, 1996, the town officially renamed Burgoyne Park as William E. Blanchfield Park in honor of the late longtime local resident and businessman. He owned the Battey Shoe Store in Elmwood for many years and raised and lowered the park’s flag every day. He volunteered extensively in youth sports and is a member of the West Hartford All Sports Council Hall of Fame. Researching the Revolutionary War Dead Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, April 2005 The voluminous work of the Veteran Memorial’s Joe Donahue, researching every veteran who died in uniform from West Hartford, compels me to try and make meaning out of the facts of their service, the tragedy of their deaths, and the sacrifice of their lives for the larger cause. The local connection makes the American Revolution come alive. Twenty-six men from the West Division died in uniform in the Revolutionary War. Three quarters of the West Division’s men died by the end of 1776, just six months into the war. Their average age was 33. Their median age was 31. Two men died at age 50 and one man died at age 17. Of the 26 men, there is a record of service for 21. Cornelius Flower served just five months before dying in camp of putrid fever. Epaphras Bull served for 56 months before he died of fever in Williamsburg, VA in September 1781, about 2 weeks before the British surrender at Yorktown. The average time of service was 17 months Eleven men died “in camp.” Seven died of fever Two of the 26 died in battle: Aaron Henery died of a wound at Fort Anne, NY, and Eli Mix died in an assault at Stony Point, New York. Three men, Jonathan Gillet, Joel Clark, and Joseph Mygat died after being released from prison ships. As soon as news of the Battle of Lexington April 19, 1775 made it to the West Division, men answered the call. Thomas Hart Hooker enlisted into Connecticut’s Second Regiment under the leadership of Captain Samuel Wyllys of Hartford on May 10, 1775, just 25 days after the Battle at Lexington in what was known as the “first call” for troops from the state legislature. Hooker served at the siege of Boston and died of peripneumonia at the age of 30. On November 26, 1775 he became the first West Division man to die in the war. Just before he left for the war, Bristow bought his freedom from Hooker for 60 pounds. Hooker’s genealogy claimed Hooker gave Bristow his liberty before going to “fight for liberty” from the British. West Division men fought in the next battle at Fort Ticonderoga. New York and three died there. Controlling Boston depended on an attack of this Fort about 150 miles away from Boston. The Green Mountain Boys, led by Benedict Arnold and Ethan Allen, surprised the British garrison and then hauled the fort’s heavy guns to Boston. The threat of bombardment forced the British to evacuate Boston. The West Division men thought, like most of the Patriots, that they were involved in a skirmish, not a Revolution. The Patriot Army left a list of artillery taken from Fort Ti. They thought they would return the arms to the British as soon as things calmed down. The British remained uncertain about whether or not they were actually engaged in war. They believed they were only quieting pockets of rebellion. West Division soldiers John Cowle, Cornelius Flowers and John Steele all died at Ticonderoga between April and October 1776. Members of their militia held onto Fort Ticonderoga to stage an assault on British Canada. Arnold threatened Quebec after a difficult winter march. The Patriots were frustrated in Canada when they could not get the Canadians to ally as a 14th state. Cowle was 50 years old when he died in the camp. He enlisted in August 1775 and died six months later. Cornelius Flowers also died at age 50 in the camp of “putrid fever.” John Steele was an army private who died of “putrid fever” as well was 17 and had served 18 months. His regiment helped Gen. Schuyler reinforce the troops besieging Quebec. They retreated in April 1776 and were stationed in Ticonderoga. The men suffered severely from smallpox. The assault on British Canada was not successful, but the British evacuated Boston and many Loyalists fled to Halifax. Nineteen of the West Division’s 26 men died in the second phase of the war in the Mid-Atlantic region. Fourteen died in 1776 and 12 of them at the outpost of Peekskill on the Hudson, north of New York City. Most of them are listed as dying “in ye camp.” Two died of “putrid fever.” The British regrouped in the waters around New York City under Sir William Howe. He had 32,000 trained soldiers. Washington had 19,000 men who were poorly armed and poorly trained. Washington had no navy. Still, the Continentals fought and suffered one defeat after another as the British pushed them out of Manhattan, over the plains of New Jersey, across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. Two West Division men, Lt. Col. Joel Clark and Private Joseph Mygat died on a prison ship in the waters around New York in 1776. The British hunkered down for the winter of 1776-7, but George Washington recrossed the Delaware River on Christmas Eve. Joseph Hulbert from the West Division was with Washington when he crossed the Delaware. Hulbert died that night. He had served for 20 months in the war. Washington’s troops scattered the Hessian soldiers and claimed two minor victories at Trenton and Princeton. In 1777, Horatio Gates defeated Burgoyne at Saratoga, New York. The citizens in the West Division were so excited that, led by Ebeneezer Faxon, they planted a living memorial in a park named Victory over Burgoyne at the northwest corner of Quaker Lane and New Britain Avenue. At the same time, Howe headed for Philadelphia taking many of his troops with him to take the Patriot capital. In Washington’s unsuccessful attack on the British at Germantown, Pennsylvania, 17 year old Lewis Stanley was killed after serving for 2 years and one month in the militia as a Minuteman. Stanley must have been 15 when he signed the second call. He died “in captivity.” He served under Col. Jebidiah Huntington at Germantown. When George Washington retreated to Valley Forge, February 16, 1778, William Wheeler, an army private was with him. Wheeler died with many others at Valley Forge where soldiers suffered from sickness, cold and starvation. Jonathan Gillett died at home after being held prisoner by German troops in British service for 18 months. The Hessians confined him on a prison ship in New York Harbor. He was disarmed, and beaten. The prison ships in New York harbor were notorious for filth, disease, and cruelty. One of Gillet’s letters to his wife Elizabeth detailed his being disarmed, beaten by the Hessian soldier’s gun butts and treated unkindly. He was released after 18 months and returned to the West Division but died in December 1779 at age 41. He and his family lived in the house just north of the Noah Webster House on the east side of Main Street. Epaphras Bull, aged 33 and a Major in the Army died of fever after serving for four and a half years in Williamsburg Virginia, just two weeks before Cornwallis’ surrender at Yorktown. About 5,000 Patriot men died in the Revolutionary War, only a fraction of the 58,000 in the Vietnam War. Out of a total population of about 1,000 people in the West Division, 26 men died – approximately 5 percent of the male population of the town. These men, whose average age was 33, left widows and families. Those on the home front sacrificed by not importing British goods. The dislocation of this war, in retrospect, loomed large. In the Vietnam War, 18 West Hartford men died out of a population of about 70,000, or 0.05 percent of the male population. But both wars split the community as its citizens debated the merits of fighting for democracy and independence. Joe Donahue’s statistics of those who died in uniform bring home the heroism, tragedy, and misery of war. Naming the New Middle School: Bristow or Sperry? Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, August 2004 As a high school history teacher, I am constantly considering what to include and what not to include in the curriculum. How much should I focus on leaders who made decisions which affected large numbers of people and changed the way people acted and thought? How much should students learn about those who left little record but were instrumental in building our nation? It is this choice, it seems, that the Board of Education is faced with in naming the new middle school on Highland Street to open in September 2005. What the Board decides will be a symbol for the community. A committee has narrowed the choice to two names: Bristow (1728-1811) and Roger W. Sperry (1913-1984). This is the choice of two men, the first who spent almost his entire life in West Hartford, and the second who spent his formative years here. This is the choice of an enslaved and then free African man and a white well-educated man. This is the choice between one man who had to fight for his very survival and another already well-recognized for his accomplishments. Each man is worthy of having a school named after him, but on the face of it, Sperry certainly has the credentials. Sperry’s brain research had a great impact on further research in psychology and medicine in the 20th century. In his lifetime, Sperry published 290 scientific articles. He discovered that the neural network that connects the sense organs and muscles to the brain is hardwired. He disproved the theory of his mentor, Paul Weiss at the University of Chicago where he got his PhD in 1941, who believed that the neural network was randomly connected. Sperry’s experiments, which included surgery on fish, salamanders, and monkeys, showed that the development of this neural network is just the opposite of what Weiss believed. In fact, each nerve cell, he found, was tagged in the embryo with its own chemical individuality and the function of the cell was fixed for life. Sperry did not win the Nobel Prize for this discovery. He won that prize for his discovery on split brains. Sperry determined that both hemispheres of the brain are conscious and can act separately. This finding came again, from Sperry questioning the accepted theory that sectioning the corpus callosum, the large band of fibers that connects the two hemispheres of the brain, did not affect behavior. Sperry investigated first with cats and monkeys, and then later on humans whose brain hemispheres were surgically separated to control epilepsy. Sperry found that the right hemisphere was conscious, and could perceive, think, remember, reason, and emote. Further, he argued, the right and left hemispheres could be conscious, carrying on mutually conflicting mental experiences at the same time. Sperry was born in Hartford to Francis Bushnell, a banker and Florence Kraener Sperry. His mother was born in Elmwood. Sperry’s father died when he was 11 and Roger took his mother’s surname. When his father died, the family moved to West Hartford, and his mother became the assistant to Hall’s principal for almost 20 years starting in 1924. Sperry went to elementary school in Elmwood possibly at Charter Oak School. In his autobiography, found on his website, Sperry wrote that he “collected and raised large American moths in grade school.” When he was at Talcott Junior High, he “ran trap line and collected live wild pets.” At Hall High School, from which he graduated in 1931, Sperry was not just an academic. He was also an accomplished athlete who lettered in football, basketball, baseball, and track. At Oberlin College, Sperry was the captain of the basketball team and also lettered in football, baseball and track. As an adult, Sperry practiced what his Hall yearbook quote proclaimed, “There’s time for work and time for play.” In 1981, at the time the Nobel Prizes were being awarded, Sperry left Caltech for a week’s fishing vacation with his wife. It was over a week before he came back and actually knew he’d won the Prize. In his spare time he was an artist in sculpting, ceramics, water colors and figure drawing. He loved American folk dancing, fishing, boating, and snorkeling. And he had a large collection of unusual fossils. Clearly, Sperry has much to offer as an inspiration to school children and townspeople. Bristow may, too, have been a renaissance man, but the documentation on him is not nearly as rich. Bristow is the only African American with a marked headstone in the Old Burial Ground on North Main Street in West Hartford. Bristow spent about half of his 83 years as an enslaved person. He was born in Africa and was involuntarily brought to the America when it was still a colony. He was owned by Thomas Hart and Sarah Whitman Hooker until 1775 when he bought his freedom for 60 British pounds. The fact that Bristow could raise 60 pounds shows the ability of enslaved people to make money and Bristow’s initiative to better his position in society. According to the recently published Celebrate! West Hartford, Bristow became an agricultural expert in his later years and farmers in town consulted with him. Booker DeVaughan, the President of the West Hartford African American Social and Cultural Organization, was the impetus behind Bristow’s new headstone in the Old Burial Ground and in getting this headstone placed on Connecticut’s Freedom Trail. DeVaughan, in his dedication of the headstone on June 12, argued that Bristow represented many attributes that make him the quintessential American. He represents those ever-present American traditions of self-improvement, upward mobility, and reinventing ourselves. We have only three pieces of primary evidence about him: his gravestone, his manumission papers, and his last will and testament. Much of what we make of Bristow comes from the ideas of social historians who study those who have not left a record and try to place them in the context of their times. We don’t know if Bristow was literate, if he had a family, or if he made any important agricultural discoveries. But we can surmise, from information gathered about involuntary African immigrants, that Bristow had no formal schooling. He probably lived in the Hooker homestead at 1237 New Britain Avenue, and probably did a variety of jobs for the Hookers. Unlike slavery in the south, where those enslaved repeated the same tasks over and over, men like Bristow in the north, could learn a trade and could hire themselves out and make money. Bristow represents the African American presence in the West Division which goes back to 1738. Sally Whipple, former Director of the Noah Webster House, researched African Americans for an exhibit the Noah Webster House in 1989. Her research through land and probate, birth, marriage, death records and account books shows how much African Americans were an integral part of the town in the 18th and 19th centuries. The first record of an enslaved African American is Jack, born in 1696 and owned by Col. Whiting. Between the years 1738 and 1791, at least 20 white West Division men and women owned at least 37 black slaves. If there were 124 families in town in 1764, over 15% of the families owned Africans. These families were those that were wealthy and leaders of the town. Two of the first three ministers, Benjamin Colton (1713-1759) and Nathan Perkins (1772-1838) owned Africans. When Colton died in 1759, his inventory listed a “Negro” worth 33 pounds. This “negro” was probably Chris who had been baptized in 1758. By law, at Colton’s death, Chris was passed on to his son Abijah Colton. John Whitman grew up in a house with slaves. To pay for purchases in 1740, Thomas Hosmer paid Whitman’s father “a negro named Ned a boy of nine years old w[orth] 115 [pounds]. Enslaved people were split from families, and even those who were free, lived in quasi-freedom. In Dr. DeVaughan’s dedication of Bristow’s headstone, he said that “with all his American traits, however, he very well may not have risen to the very pinnacle of success. He was marginalized because of who he was… freedom for Bristol and his contemporaries was severely limited.” Students in my Local History class leaned toward naming the school after Bristow. “We stand for diversity in this town,” one student said, and “we shouldn’t just give it lip service.” Another said that Bristow spent all his life in West Hartford and that gave him an edge. Both these men are exemplary. The more I read about Sperry, the more I think, how could the Board not choose him? Yet there is this part of me that also wants to celebrate the common person, the ordinary citizen who rose above the circumstances to which he was tethered in slavery, the one who represents struggle, freedom and a measure of success beyond what was expected of him. But these attributes could apply to Roger Sperry whose father died when he was young and whose scientific career is characterized by his questioning established theories of giants in his field. Is the symbol more valuable if the person has reached the pinnacle of society, or is someone who would live among us? Contact your Board of Education members (Jack Darcy, Beth Bye, Bruce Putterman, Harry Captain, Terry Schmitt, Tom Fiorentino, or Jeanette Becker) with your opinion about the school name. Lemuel Haynes Crossed the Color Line Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, September 2011 Who has crossed the color line? Many people in the United States today can lay claim to a family member, neighbor, or friend who has crossed the color line in marriage or in a lasting relationship of some type. In the mid-1990s Gary Nash, a UCLA history professor, helped to start a movement called Mixed Race Studies in which historians, sociologists and artists focus on understanding multiracial, interracial and transracial adoption populations with a focus on social justice. Mixed race studies scholars challenge dominant conceptions about race, emphasizing the flexibility of race and the porosity of racial boundaries. They critique how social stratification is often based on race. West Hartford was the birthplace of Lemuel Haynes (1753 - 1833), a man of mixed race who married a white woman. Haynes’ legacy has been resurrected by the PBS series, Africans in America (1998) and by Gary Nash’s book, Forbidden Love: The Hidden History of Mixed-Race America (2010). On July 18, 1753 in the West Division of Hartford, Lemuel Haynes was born to a father of “unmingled African extraction” and Scottish servant girl Alice Fitch. Lemuel took the name of Fitch’s master, John Haynes of West Hartford, likely a descendant of John Haynes, the first governor of the Connecticut Colony who served eight terms and was instrumental in writing the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. Haynes took the name of his mother’s master rather than that of his father, implying that his father was enslaved. Lee Ellenwood, former minister at the First Church of Christ, Congregational, suggested that his father may have been Bristow. Five months after Haynes was born, his mother gave him up to Deacon David Rose of Granville, Massachusetts, who took him in as an indentured servant. Part of the agreement was that Haynes be educated. Though not much is known of his youth, Haynes spent time helping out on the farm. He attended church and showed a passion for the Bible and books on theology. In his teens, he was exposed to Calvinist thought and conducted services at his local church. At age 21, Haynes’ indenture expired. He joined the Minutemen of Granville. Haynes marched with his militia company to Roxbury after the Revolutionary War battles of Lexington and Concord. He also volunteered in the expedition to Ticonderoga, NY in 1776 to help protect the fort. In 1776, Haynes wrote a well-circulated pamphlet entitled “Liberty Further Extended” in which he said “That an African… has an undeniable right to his liberty.” Haynes condemned slavery and was one of the earliest to point out the irony of slave owners fighting for their own liberty while denying it to those of African descent. When he returned to Granville, he was offered a scholarship to Dartmouth College but turned it down and “apprenticed” with local Congregational ministers, learning theology, Greek and Latin, and how to write and deliver sermons. He spent 1780 in Wintonbury (Bloomfield) studying Greek with the Rev. William Bradford while teaching in the local one-room schoolhouse. He was a Calvinist who read revivalists George Whitfield and Jonathan Edwards from the first Great Awakening. He believed in the absolute sovereignty of God and that human virtue was a reflection of God’s love. Haynes married Elizabeth Babbitt, who was white, in 1783 in Hartland and stayed married to her for 50 years. They had 10 biracial children born between 1785 and 1804. One of their sons became a physician and another a lawyer. Haynes was licensed to preach in 1780 and in 1785 was the first African American officially ordained a minister of the Congregational Church. He was first called to be pastor of the Torrington Congregational Church from 1785-1787. He was the first black man in America to serve as a pastor to a white congregation. However, he left after to two years because of the active prejudice of the all-white congregation. Haynes served as a pastor from 1785 to 1833. He was popular as a preacher and as an intellectual. In his 1776 pamphlet “Liberty Further Extended,” Haynes condemned slavery and was one of the first to point out, in writing, the irony of white men fighting for liberty while enslaving those of African descent. Source: Archives, First Church of Christ Congregational, West Hartford, CT, John P. Webster Library. Haynes’ longest pastorate was in Rutland, Vt., where he served for 31 years from 1787-1818 until he was 64. While there, his fame as preacher and scholar spread. He earned a transatlantic reputation largely due to his 1804 published sermon against the idea of universalism. Under Haynes, the church grew from 46 members to more than 300. In 1804 Middlebury College presented him with an honorary degree, the first of his race to win such an award. But by 1818 he said that conflicts had grown within his congregation that at first seemed to be about politics and style, but in the end seemed to be more based on racism. He was so popular in Vermont that he preached at a different church every Sunday after his dismissal and then served for three years in a Manchester, Vermont, church. He finally moved to Granville, NY and served his last 11 years as its pastor. Haynes’ homestead in Granville is now part of the National Historic Register and he and his wife are buried in the cemetery in South Granville, just a mile from his house. Since his rediscovery in the 20th century, Haynes has been criticized for not coming out strongly enough against slavery. But he needs to be seen in the context of his times. He would have been at the forefront of a moderate approach to the abolition of the slave trade. According to Gary Nash, he never stopped preaching that “liberty is equally as precious to a black man as to a white one, and bondage equally as intolerable to the one as it is to the other.” Haynes’ life exemplified the tension between the ideology of freedom in the new republic and that of slavery, as he argued for the full inclusion of African peoples in the new republic. Haynes crossed the color line yet had to constantly be aware of his color in a country divided by race. His legacy to his birthplace can be to ask if race determines what neighborhoods people live in, if race determines school achievement and if race determines socioeconomic status. Studying men like Lemuel Haynes can help us to see the social construction of race and help us to think more about whether race overpowers other human attributes which contribute to success. If race does, it makes us wonder even further about those willing to cross that color line. Why are people like Haynes willing and able to buck societal norms and cross the color line? Who plays Haynes’ role today? "],

Webster yearned for a strong national government and an American culture that emerged from the American Revolution based on the power of citizens. How did Webster want to define this new government and why? October 16, 2008 marks the 250th anniversary of Noah Webster’s birth in the West Division of Hartford and the Noah Webster House will be celebrating Webster’s legacy in a number of ways this fall. Though he was not considered a “founding father,” Webster was a man who was part of the founding generation who weighed in on many key political issues. While Noah Webster is most famous for his 1828 dictionary, and in West Hartford for his Blue Back Speller, he boasted that he was the first person to call for a strong federal government two years before the Constitution was written in 1787. In Webster’s Sketches in American Policy (1785), written as a four-part pamphlet, he outlined the need for a strong central government. His arguments helped him define an American character different from Europeans and from the native “savages.” At age 26, Webster was bold enough to print his Sketches, and in fact the record shows that James Madison, author of the Constitution, read it. According to Webster’s most recent biographer Harlow Unger, Sketches had “a far wider circulation than any other published Federalist document prior to the Constitutional Convention and covered a broader range of issues.” In the fourth section of Webster’s pamphlet, he urged the public to call for a stronger central government based on the will of the people, not based on power that emanated from state governments. Webster knew citizens feared that a strong central government could lead to tyranny, the main issue of the American Revolution. Webster believed that a strong central government, abolishing slavery, and a good educational system would all protect Americans from tyranny. Webster argued that until the 1780s, three principles made an independent state: a standing army, a government controlled by religion, which made government less transparent, and the fear of an enemy nation. After the Revolutionary War ended, according to Webster, none of these existed in the United States. He believed standing armies should be banished from free governments because they could easily be used as an instrument of tyranny. The Confederation Congress did establish a standing army in 1785, but it was under civilian control and Webster did not perceive it as a threat to democracy. He argued that Christianity had been separated from the state and thus would work in a spirit of peace and harmony, not coercion as it was used in many European countries. Even though Connecticut had an established church, and citizens paid taxes to that church, Webster did not believe the Congregational faith was used to keep people in ignorance. Webster did not feel that either Canada or Mexico were enemies that would unite us and he believed that we would stay out of Europe’s business, so Americans would not be united by a common enemy. Webster wrote his Sketches with a sense that there needed to be national government that would help bind us into an American nation. States could easily opt out of any decision made by the Confederation Congress with no penalty. The most famous example was both Rhode Island’s and New York’s refusal to support taxes in the form of an import duty. The Congress needed money to pay off war debts, but the fear of a far away government raising taxes was too much for either state. Hadn’t they just fought a war about taxes and hadn’t they wanted a voice in that taxation? Now that they were represented in the government, Rhode Island and New York chose to use their prerogative to stop the import tax. Webster wrote, “So long as any individual state has power to defeat the measures of the other twelve, our pretended union is but a name, and our confederation, a cobweb” (p. 32). Webster did not see the Congress as established by the Articles of Confederation defining an American nation. The government allowed for each individual state to stop the nation from acting as one. But, he also knew that Americans feared tyranny. How to strike the balance? To protect against tyranny and have a unified government, Webster argued that power should be vested in the people, not in state governments. Under the Articles, representatives were elected by state legislatures, and thus were beholden to state governments, not to the people. Webster’s plan was to have equal congressional representation chosen annually by the citizens. He believed there should be a three-year limit on the length that magistrates could serve to insure that the people were heard. In Sketches, Webster explained how an executive could work to enforce the laws without being tyrannical; he used Connecticut’s Governor as an example. He wrote: The state elects a governor or supreme magistrate and cloaths him with the power of the whole state to enforce the laws. Under him a number of subordinate magistrates such as judges of courts, justices of the peace, sheriffs, etc. are appointed to administer the laws in their respective departments. These are commissioned by the governor or supreme magistrate. Thus the whole power of the state is brought to a single point; it is united in one person (p. 33). Webster put his faith in the citizens to elect the best people. He thought that if elections were held frequently and the freemen were treated equally, the government would be free of tyranny. In a footnote, he explained how he chose to vote for a candidate: People, in the choice of rulers, are too apt to be deceived by … a specious show of popular virtues. I pretend not to lay down rules for other people; but for my own part, I will never give my vote to a man who courts my favor. I always suspect that such a man will be the first to betray me. Nor, will I give my vote to men, merely because they have been in office and it will hurt their feelings to be neglected. Such motives appear to me to discover weakness and a disregard to the true principles of government. I endeavor to give my votes to men, in whose integrity and abilities I can repose confidence; men, who will not dispense with law and rigid justice, to favor a friend or secure their own popularity. When I hear people talk of elevating a man to an office, because be comes next in course, and he will do well enough, I suspect they have forgot that they are freemen, and have lost their oaths or their consciences (p. 34). Webster’s words ring true today as we head toward the polls in November. At an early age, Webster knew the importance of an enlightened citizenry to make the right decision about who represented them. This power in the hands of ordinary citizens, he believed, was the core of the American identity. Noah Webster, 248 Years Later Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, September 2006 The 13 foot, 8.5 ton marble statue of Noah Webster, with one finger missing, endangered by acid rain and errant vines, is gone from its spot at 50 South Main Street. On Thursday, August 11, 2006, conservators removed Korczak Ziolkowski’s statue which had graced the lawn of the old Town Hall building for 65 years. The statue is part of the town’s logo and Webster’s presence symbolizes the town’s dedication to learning. Naming the new development Blue Back Square is further evidence of the man’s influence in the town. Webster’s 250th birthday will be here in just two years and already the Noah Webster House and West Hartford Historical Society is planning a bash. What form will this take? How will we remember Webster in 2008? In 1958 for his 200th birthday, West Hartford had no ordinary celebration. The West Hartford Historical Society and the Noah Webster Bicentennial Committee held a parade, followed by a “huge community banquet” at Temple Beth Israel on Farmington Avenue. Governor Abraham Ribicoff, U.S. Senator William A. Purtell, U.S. Representatives Edwin May, Thomas Dodd and Rohe Walter attended both events. The parade began on Memorial Drive, stopped for a ceremony at Webster’s statue on South Main Street, and then proceeded east on Farmington Avenue all the way to South Highland Street. The parade included the Governor’s Foot Guard, Governor’s Horse Guard, the Conard High Band, the West Hartford Remington Riders and a number of floats. The celebration included a four cent Noah Webster commemorative stamp first available here and delivered to all West Hartford homes by their mailman as a souvenir. Businesses in the community sponsored the mailing. A town wide spelling bee on October 15 was held at the Duffy School, with Ross Miller of WTIC as master of ceremonies. Governor Ribicoff presented the keynote address. Included at the head table with him were the president of the Merriam Company which owned the Webster dictionary, Mayor Harold Keith, and ministers from three faiths in West Hartford. Along with the postage stamp, every home in town also received a pamphlet called “Your Schools” devoted to Noah Webster and produced by the School Department. The West Hartford News produced a 24 page “souvenir supplement” on Webster. Henry Steele Commager (1902-1998), the head of the history department at Amherst College, wrote the cover article. At that point, Commager was “one of America’s most noted historians,” a devotee of the consensus school of American History. This same article appeared in the Saturday Review just two days later. Commager was a prolific writer who believed that history should inform the public discourse. He continually transcended the divide between the academic and the public world as he lectured extensively and wrote hundreds of articles and columns for the public press. He campaigned for political candidates, railed against the anti-communism of Senator Joseph McCarthy, and publicly opposed the Vietnam War. He rallied other liberal historians like Arthur Schlesinger behind his causes. So what did Commager say about Webster almost 50 years ago? Commensurate with the consensus school of history, Commager argued that Webster’s Blue Back Speller served to draw all Americans together with a common language. Commager argued that “under its benign guidance, generations of young Americans learned the same spellings, the same pronunciations; read the same stories; absorbed the same moral lessons.” Commager claimed that Webster deserved to be considered one of the Founding Fathers and clearly he was “Father of the American language… and of American education.” According to Commager he was also a Father of American political thought in his Sketches in American Policy (1785) and as editor of the American Magazine, the Minerva, and the Herald through the 1830s. Webster was a leader in science with his two volume work the History of Epidemics. He was the father of the copyright, one of the first to write about American history, and American banking and finance. Webster, like Thomas Jefferson, rewrote the Bible, and wrote the first American dictionary in 1806 and then in 1828. Yet, according to Commager, Webster did not have the mind of a Jefferson or Franklin. He claimed Webster was full of “nagging ambition, grim determination and indefatigable officiousness… and vanity.” For all his wide range of interests, Webster “did not have an open mind.” Commager argued that Webster was: narrow, cold, almost passionless, [and] was wholly lacking in those grace-notes his great contemporaries added to their scores with such ease. He read everything, but in order to get definitions for his dictionary; he taught music, bur revealed not the slightest interest in the musical giants of his own time; he studied history, but only to learn that man is vile. He knew the languages of 20 nations but was interested in none of these; he visited France only to deplore its licentiousness; he visited Cambridge only to remark on the inferiority of its architecture. He was devout, but curiously untouched by religious sentiment… He was zealous for education, but had little faith in the young, and thought voting should be restricted to those over forty-five. Even so, Commager believed that Webster was much more than his personality. He should be remembered for his desire and ability to build an American culture. Commager thought that, through language, he diminished the role of class, background, or region to invent a common culture, especially with his Blue Back Speller. Commager argued that “no other secular book has ever spread so wide, penetrated so deep, lasted so long.” And, Commager said, Webster was typical of his age. The Founding Fathers were intent on building a national character which differentiated this new country with the corruption and division of the Old World. No longer would the Monarchy, the Church, the Aristocracy, or the Military be the definers of the nation. For Commager, Webster’s role as “teacher” was his most important role. In 1958, Commager argued that “in America the teacher should play a larger role in the creation of nationalism than almost anywhere else. . .because the United States was the first nation to inaugurate anything remotely like universal free education.” Webster was the first to write “moral and patriotic readers.” On page one of Part III of the Blue Back Speller, Webster wrote, “Begin with the infant in the cradle; let the first word he lisps be Washington.” Webster believed that learning about the great men would build pride in nation. Commager concluded that Webster’s most important contribution to American culture was building a pride in the American language and literature. Even though he was a practical and utilitarian in all he did, his key contribution was developing a belief in the United States as a unified, successful, self-sufficient whole. Interestingly, Commager prided himself on being a teacher first and scholar and writer second. In the midst of the Cold War, an excellent education system for all seemed to distinguish us from Communist countries, as well. In 2008, on Webster’s 250th birthday, with a national consumer culture, but a country as ethnically diverse as ever, will our interpretation of Webster’s influence on the nation change? Do we still consider a common language a binding force? Does education tell our nation’s story? Is this education accessible to all? Stay tuned! The Noah Webster House is reviving the Noah Webster Birthday Party. Come September 30 for the celebration! Noah Webster’s Social Life Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, August 2007 I found the green shoebox the other day – the one I was looking for. It holds 3 x 5 cards on which I tracked social meetings Noah Webster had with his friends and acquaintances in the 1780s. The box is a size 9 ½ wide (that’s children’s size) and it is 2/3 full of cards noting people with whom Webster met from 1783 (when he was 25) to 1786. Let’s see, 9 ½ wide means my oldest son was about 3. Sixteen years ago seems like I might have entered these social interactions on the computer. If I did, I could manipulate them by date, by activity, by gender, and by place, but alas, I have them alphabetized by last name in this green shoebox. So, I have a chance to look back at events on paper. I have about 500 cards and to me, this is the stuff of history. How do I make sense of them? I remember why I put them on note cards. That summer when I read the book compiled by Webster’s granddaughter, Emily Ellsworth Fowler Ford, Notes on the Life of Noah Webster (1912), I was amazed by the number of times Webster socialized. Ford’s book was a compilation of seven first printings of extracts, letters, memos and diaries of his life. In 1912, the book was privately printed, and was reprinted in 1971. The Noah Webster House has a copy of the two-volume work. Was there a pattern in who Webster talked to? Was this an average number of interactions in the time period? Webster’s life will be celebrated next year in town as we reach the 250th anniversary of his birth. Americans like anniversaries and we like to revise our history as well. As the West Hartford Historical Society and Noah Webster House gear up for this grand event, we struggle with the issue of who Webster really was. If you look at the paintings and sculpture and read some of what he wrote – there is a 500-page bibliography of his writing – he has the reputation of being ponderous, taciturn and a bit overbearing. But all these interactions make me think he was something more. He wrote the Blue-Back Speller in 1783 and we know to make money from the speller he had to travel to each state to secure publication rights to his book. There were no national copyright laws and printers could buy the book and just print it and gain the reward. Webster traveled up and down the Atlantic seaboard selling his book, selling the idea of an American language, boosting public education, and pestering state legislators to pass copyright laws to protect intellectual property. Perhaps the travel to push for copyright laws led him to believe in a stronger national government. In fact, in 1785, two years before the Constitutional Convention, Webster called for a stronger central government in his pamphlet, Sketches of American Policy. His social interactions show him talking to leaders of the revolutionary generation. A quick look through my cards reveals that he took tea, dined, danced, and would “wait on them,” meaning to go to see or visit on business. As a looked at the cards and wrote this article, I “googled” the men he visited. Today information about the revolutionary generation is right at my fingertips – a big change from 16 years ago. Between November 1785, and March 1786, Webster met with Mr. Moses Austin seven times, dining three times and taking tea with him four times. Moses Austin, 34 years later set out for Texas, petitioning for a land grant to settle 300 families on 200,000 acres of land. His son Stephen Austin, carried out his plan. In May 1785, Webster took tea with Col. Aaron Burr and his wife Mrs. Theodosia Prevost Burr. Burr married Theodosia in July 1782 when he was 26 and she 36 with five children. She was the widow of a former colonel of the British Army and some questioned her loyalty to the new country. Webster knew her because he taught her children when he was a schoolmaster in Sharon, Connecticut. Just 10 months later, Webster met with the family again in Philadelphia. Burr was a member of the New York State Assembly at the time of their meeting. On a 1786 visit to Philadelphia, Webster met with Benjamin Rush. In February and then in March Webster dined with him. Rush, like Webster, had many interests including physician, writer, educator, humanitarian, and finally a professor of medical theory and clinical practice at the University of Pennsylvania. He was an early opponent of slavery and capital punishment. Webster heard Mr. Moyes and Dr. Rush speak on “harmony of tastes.” Moyes, who was blind, was a lecturer and professor of the philosophy of mathematics, engineering, and the history of medicine. Webster had tea with Moyes, attended his first benefit lecture on air, attended his last lecture and on two different occasions wrote that he “waited on him.” Rush was a very good friend of John Dickinson of Wilmington, Delaware. Webster met Dickinson in February 1786, possibly through his connection with Benjamin Rush. Webster noted that Dickinson wrote Letters from an American Farmer in Pennsylvania (1767-8), which united the colonists against the Townshend Acts. Webster declared him a “sensible man.” Dickinson was one of the wealthiest men in America who served for four years, until 1785 as the President of Pennsylvania. Rush was the founder of Dickinson College in Pennsylvania in 1783, named after John Dickinson. Webster met at least three times in late 1785 and early 1786 with a Mr. Samuel Curson of Baltimore. Curson was a merchant who traded corn, wheat, wines, flour, slaves, gunpowder, tobacco and rice in the U.S., the Caribbean, Africa, and England. On September 28, 1785, Webster noted that Curson was a man of “respectable character.” In October, Webster met him for tea, and three months later in January 1786, they dined together. In April 1786, Mr. Burling of New York killed Curson in a duel. The dispute seemed to be over Curson fathering a child with Burling’s sister. Burling wanted Curson to pay him money and he pursued Curson from the West Indies to London and finally to America. Burling challenged Curson to a duel and stabbed him in the groin. Curson died three days later. I wonder how much Webster knew of the allegations when he deemed Curson a “respectable character.” This article was spun from seven out of my 500 cards. The possibilities of making sense of Webster’s social life through historical research right at my fingertips is something I could not have imagined 16 years ago. Webster, at a young age, was a man of the world and must have been pleasant company. My cards show he had numerous meetings with the same people and then they introduced him to their friends. Knowing something about his meetings helps us to open a window into the social context of a world of ideas, duels and travel that are not so familiar to us today. There’s a lot more to learn from my green shoebox! Noah Webster the Federalist Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, July 2007 In 1800 at age 42, Noah Webster penned a pamphlet called “A Rod for the Fool’s Back,” in which he took New Haven’s Abraham Bishop to task for supporting Democratic-Republican principles. The pamphlet, published in New Haven, was part of a flurry of pamphlets stirred up by the Democratic-Republican win in the 1800 national election. Webster’s pamphlet was a searing commentary not only on Bishop’s beliefs, but also on his virtue. Webster believed that Bishop cared only about his own self interest, and that his political beliefs would hurt the common good. Webster was a staunch Federalist who believed in a strong national government, a standing army and navy, and a unified culture based on a common language. On a national level, Democratic-Republicans like Bishop believed that we needed no foreign diplomats, no national debt, and no attention by the government to commerce. Connecticut Democratic-Republicans had so little power that the 1800 federal election win gave them some hope. From 1800 to 1816, in five straight elections, Connecticut voters cast the majority of ballots for Federalists. In 1804 only Connecticut and Delaware gave their electoral votes to the Federalist Charles Pinckney. In 1816 when James Monroe ran against Federalist Rufus King, Connecticut once again voted for the Federalist, this time with two other states. Being a Democratic Republican in Connecticut meant being in the minority, even though nationally they were the majority. Webster’s support of the Federalists was mainstream for Connecticut. Webster found himself embroiled in a debate about both national politics and the state Charter of 1662, which unlike most other colonial constitutions, had not been replaced in the 1780s after we separated from England. But by 1800, when Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson defeated Federalist John Adams for the presidency, followers of Jefferson in Connecticut were encouraged to believe they should have some say in state politics. Both sides used both national and state issues to garner support. By 1800, Webster had been married for 11 years and had four of his eight children. In 1798, Webster moved to New Haven from New York City where he edited the Federalist American Minerva, New York’s first daily newspaper. From 1802 to 1807, Webster, the Federalist, represented New Haven in Connecticut’s General Assembly. He helped make the laws to carry out Connecticut’s 1662 charter. The national fight between the Federalists and the Democratic–Republicans spilled over into state issues. The Connecticut state government “established” or supported the Congregational Church with tax money longer than any other state in the union. When all but Connecticut and Rhode Island rewrote their state constitutions in the 1780s and disestablished their Congregational churches, Connecticut did not do so until 1818, because of the power of the Federalists here. The Federalists believed that their policies furthered the common good and used the tactic that Democratic Republicans did not understand the common good – only their own self-interest. The Charter of 1662 required all people to attend Sunday services and pay taxes to support the local church unless they got a certificate signed by an officer of a dissenting church, like the Baptists, Quakers, or Episcopalians. A 1791 law stated that the certificate had to be signed by two civil officers, always Congregationalists, and so the dissenters were often harassed. These laws, while attempting to solidify the power of the Congregationalists, actually caused an uproar among the dissenters like Bishop, and helped them to get support from the Republicans. Webster was a Congregationalist, but one who did not support the establishment of a particular denomination. He believed, as he said in his 1828 dictionary, that religion was the source of virtue: In my view, the Christian religion is the most important and one of the first things in which all children, under a free government, ought to be instructed… No truth is more evident to my mind than that the Christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of a free people… However, unlike other Federalists, Webster had a more wide-ranging view of religion and did not feel that Congregationalism was better than other Christian sects. He would have been happy with the 1818 Constitution, which disestablished the Congregational Church but privileged Christianity. In Webster’s pamphlet, his religious views come out by lumping Bishop, a deist with “Atheists, Adulterers and profligate men” who will “lead the people to destruction.” Webster characterized Bishop’s pamphlet as “mere rant, declamation and incongruous sentiments, incapable of being comprehended, much less answered.” He claimed that Bishop wanted to be part of the state government only for his own self-interest, not for the good of all. Webster argued that the state was doing very well economically, so why would anyone want change? The government’s regulation of trade and its relationships with other countries were very important to the Federalists, but not to the Democratic Republicans. Bishop believed all foreign entanglements were a waste of good taxpayer money. Bishop believed that Alexander Hamilton’s funding scheme for Revolutionary War state debts was a “calamity” and led to “aristocracy, even more so than in France.” Democratic Republicans did not believe in having a national debt, or in funding state debts incurred during the Revolution. They believed that a citizen’s allegiance should be to his state, not to his nation. Webster countered by saying that only a small number of speculators grew rich off the funding scheme. In fact, Webster argued, independent farmers got most of the money. When the Constitution was written, Democratic-Republicans won the election of 1817 to push for the Constitutional Convention. Once the Democratic-Republicans held power, they could change the charter. The Constitution opened up suffrage to all white men. But Webster clung to his Federalist beliefs claiming: The very principle of admitting everybody to the right of suffrage prostrates the wealth of individuals to the rapaciousness of a merciless gang who have nothing to lose and will delight in plundering their neighbors. In the early 19th century, as both state and local issues became part of the political world, Webster held fast to the ideas of the Federalists long after the party had lost its national and then state power. He believed that the right people who served in government had to protect the state from those who were in government only for their only self-interest. While Webster believed he knew who those leaders were and what their vision of the US was, so did Bishop. Each believed they would serve for the common good and both believed the other was in politics for their own self-interest, a conflict which appears in politics to this day. Noah Webster and Amos Beman Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, November 2005. Thank you to Robert Forbes at Yale for bringing my attention to this letter. In 1840, Noah Webster, age 82, wrote the following letter to Amos G. Beman, a black Congregational minister and abolitionist in New Haven. Mr. Beman, I have your note of thanks, with a request that I would refer you to such authors as may give you some account of the origins of the African race. In answer, I would remark that of the woolly haired Africans, who constitute the principal part of the inhabitants of Africa, there is no history. There can be none. That race has remained in barbarism from the first ages of the world; their country has never been explored very fully by civilized men, &amp; the late efforts of travelers to penetrate to the sources of the Niger, have not been very successful. Of the nations inhabiting the northern portions of Africa, who are of a different origin, viz. the Egyptians, Carthaginians and Numidians, I suppose you will find the best accounts in some Encyclopedia, under the words Copt, Egypt, Carthage &amp; Numidia – add also Moors. Yours respectfully, N Webster A twenty-first century reader may well cringe at this correspondence. But a closer look at Webster’s times and at Amos Beman’s beliefs can illuminate the range of ideas about racial equality in the early 19th century. For many years, scholars have argued that Connecticut’s treatment of African Americans both enslaved and free, was paternalistic and overshadowed by abolitionists. However, recent scholarly research and books for a popular audience like the newly published book Complicity: How the North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited from Slavery by Anne Farrow, Joel Lang, and West Hartford’s Jenifer Frank, challenge this view. The authors describe how much whites in the north participated in the institution of slavery either by owning slaves or profiting through trade. This milieu sets a context in which Webster could make a statement which was degrading to Africans. Webster’s letter was typical of nineteenth-century “white” American opinion. Webster and his contemporaries assumed that vast, fixed, biological, and intellectual differences separated Europeans from Africans. He believed these things were fixed by nature, not constructed by human beings. These assumptions led to a tremendous cultural divide between the Africans themselves, and whites who supported emancipation but not equality and those few whites who supported emancipation and equality. A belief like Webster’s led to decades of racial discrimination before, during and after the Civil War. As early as 1785, Webster wrote that he wanted the abolition of slavery to be part of a new constitution. In 1791, Noah Webster co-founded Hartford’s Society for the Abolition of Slavery. He believed, as many northerners did in the 19th century, that slavery should end, but he never conceived of free blacks having the same rights as whites. Lincoln, in his writings and speeches, claims to want to free the slaves, but he does not accept social, political, or economic equality, just a short time after Webster died in 1843. Webster’s writings 50 years earlier, in the 1790s reflect interest in emancipating slaves, but not in equality. In 1793, Webster published a lecture called “Effects of Slavery on Morals and Industry,” in which he argued that it was not economically profitable to favor enslaved over free labor. Webster believed he needed to convince slave owners that it was in their best economic interest to emancipate slaves. He felt slave owners would be alienated by appealing to them about the immorality or cruelty of slavery. And, there were many who perceived that slavery uplifted what Webster stated was the “race [that] has remained in barbarism.” Webster may have seen educated, Christian, free blacks in a different light than the Africans in Africa, but clearly he gives Beman very little to feel good about in this letter. Amos G. Beman, the recipient of Webster’s letter was a black minister and abolitionist leader from the Temple Street African Congregational Church in New Haven, who later served the Talcott Street Church in Hartford. Both Amos Beman and his father Jehiel organized abolitionist and political conventions throughout Connecticut. They were leaders of Connecticut’s black abolitionist movement, and they led a successful petition drive in 1847 for black suffrage which was passed by the General Assembly. However, the right to vote was defeated in a statewide referendum soon after. Clarissa Beman, Amos’ first wife founded the Colored Female Anti-Slavery Society in 1834, the second one of its kind in the country. Beman’s Congregational and evangelical religious beliefs moved him to be an abolitionist, in many of the same ways it moved many white Congregationalists. Beman believed that all people – British, American and African – suffered from sin. He believed Jesus would emancipate equally all people from the slavery of sin. This salvation would lead to a colorblind society. Beman believed God treated all sinners equally. He believed that black people had a moral obligation to reform themselves. Beman believed that people had to try to eradicate selfishness and be kind. He preached against drinking alcohol, theater-going, and the use of tobacco. He argued that if black people could show white society that they were morally pure, they would more likely win the right to vote. Lewis Tappan and Beman helped found and later served on the executive committee of, the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society. Beman recommended disobedience of the Fugitive Slave Law and made his Hartford church a station on the Underground Railroad. Beman’s religious and moral beliefs matched those of many of the white religious abolitionists. Perhaps part of Webster’s point is that education is the hallmark of civilization; Webster knew Africans in Africa were not educated as Americans were. Webster is certainly willing to correspond with the educated Beman, but Webster cannot see any history of people who had no written language or formal schools. Beman believed, like Webster did about white people, that blacks had a history. Webster could not fit that into his frame of reference. However distasteful Webster’s words may be to us today, if we do not listen to Webster’s voice, it makes the Civil War and equal rights seem inevitable. A look at the tensions of the 1840s makes us realize that racial equality and abolition were clearly contested terrain that we still address. It is our job to try to understand the motives of men like Webster and Beman. This allows us to see the past as a contentious playing field of ideas and actions, not one ordained by nature or God.

They have more things: more toys, more sports equipment, more books, computers, electronics and even different types of food. The material trappings of a 21st century life reflect not only what we have, but also our values. Different things surround me, and my beliefs are shaped, to a degree, by these possessions. Historians look back in time to reveal both what we have in common with those who lived before us and what makes us different. They like to discover connections between people over time that reveal not only what they own, but also what they thought and felt. An 1836 inventory from West Division resident Thomas Barrows gives a snapshot of his world. When Barrows died in 1836, officials from the town came to his home and enumerated all of his belongings. When I read his inventory, a list that goes on for five and a half columns, I see evidence about how life changed in the West Division from 1770 to the 1830s, and I think about how national and world events contributed. The first industrial revolution began in the U.S. because of an embargo of British goods caused by the war of 1812. With the embargo, Americans began to manufacture more of their own products outside the home and shops and factories. This began with the mass production of textiles in Lowell, Massachusetts, around 1815 and continued with mass production of chairs, pottery, and carpets. Manufacturers used new technology and a new organization of work to produce better goods at a cheaper price. As farmers began to specialize and produce a surplus, they joined the market economy and had the means to buy more products. Transportation improved with the coming of the steam engine and railroads; the steamboat and canals also encouraged trade. Thomas Barrow’s inventory does not let us down on this score. His belongings revealed the increase in the amount of goods Americans possessed. He had more than 40 pieces of clothing including nine coats, nine pairs of pantaloons, six cotton shirts and nine vests. This is far more clothing than the three sets of clothing the average man had in the 1770s. Cloth was cheap and without having to spin, women had more time to sew clothing. Even though he had a great wheel, it is likely it was used only for spinning thread for specialty items, not for everyday cloth. He had one pair of boots and three pair of shoes. Some items tell us about trade. He had a silk handkerchief, silk stockings and a palm leaf hat. The China trade, which began in the 1780s, continued, and the interest in producing silk cloth in Connecticut had begun. Cheney Mills in Manchester started to produce silk cloth. It is likely the palm leaf hat came from the British -controlled islands in the Caribbean. The Barrows inventory reflected the increased importance of individualism found in the amount of silverware. In the 1770s, some inventories list no silverware. Barrows had three sets of knives and forks, two large silver spoons, five tablespoons and twelve silver teaspoons. He had a tin wash basin. In the 1770s, wash basins were made of pottery. The 1850 census shows that a tinner actually lived in town. Barrows also had tin funnels, a tin coffee pot and a tin two-quart measure. In the 1770s, measuring for baking was done with a pottery cup with no markings. In the 1830s, the first recipe books came out which required more exact measurements. New foods were available and cooking changed as people began to use cook stoves rather than cook over an open fireplace. No longer was a meal made as a stew in one pot. Barrows owned a carpet, a new addition to home decorating. This was a sign that people had money beyond what it took to provide food and shelter. Carpet mills in Tariffville and Thompsonville had already started to manufacture these carpets. Though there is no evidence in his inventory, some people put wallpaper on their walls for the first time and others added curtains. This ability to decorate was not just an activity of the rich, but served the middle class as well. Barrows’ brass clock may have come from the fledgling clock industry in Waterbury and signified an increased interest in time, which came with industrialization’s marketing of a workday in hours. But some things continued. Reminding us of 60 years earlier, Barrows had a horse harness, leather halter, horse whip and draft chain, a plow, a wood saw, 30 harrow teeth, a hoe, an axe, an iron crowbar, an ox yoke and an iron shovel, all tools of a farmer. Barrows had a Bible and a psalm book and these were his only books. He had horses, swine, sheep and cows. He had 4 pounds of wool rolls, 5 bushels of wheat, 4 bushels of rye, 2 and a half bushels of wheat, 100 bushels of potatoes, 17 pounds of butter, 10 tons of hay, 6 barrels of cider and 75 pounds of cheese. These items showed continuity with the past. He had mulberry trees worth $14, the value of one of his 24 acres of land. Silkworms live in mulberry trees, and there was an idea that they could grow silkworms in New England for the silk industry. Only two years later the Cheney Silk Mills opened in Manchester. Why would Barrows take a risk and invest in mulberry trees? As a budding capitalist, he had an idea that his investment could bring him some profit along the way. He had to have a surplus to take the risk; he had to have an idea to take the risk. He had to have the means to procure a tree, all things that took time and money. Woefully, this experiment with mulberry trees was unsuccessful, though the silk industry in Connecticut was quite profitable from the 1840s to the 1920s. Thomas Barrows’ inventory provides a snapshot into a life during Andrew Jackson’s presidency that shows both continuity and change. He was both a traditional man with his roots in farming, but also a man accepting new ideas with his carpet and his mulberry trees. Often it is our grounding in the past that allows us to try new things. Diversity in West Hartford Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, November 2003 According to the 2000 United States census, 22% of West Hartford residents spoke a language other than English at home. The languages spoken in these homes included Spanish (6.4%), other European (11%) and Asian (4%). Almost 15% of the town’s residents are foreign born. Of these foreign born, 46% come from Europe, 28% from Asia, 16% from Latin America, 6% from North America, and 4% from Africa. When residents report their ancestries, the largest was Irish at almost 17%, followed by Italian (11%), English (10%), Germans (9%), Polish (6%) and Russian (6%). When residents were asked about their race, 86% indicated they were white, 6.3% Hispanic, 4.8% African American, and 4.8% Asian. This represents a population which many consider to be much more diverse than West Hartford has ever been. In the schools, the differences are even more defined. That is, at Conard, for instance, about 12% are Hispanic, 9% African American and 9% Asian, about double that of the general population. These groups tend to be younger and have families. However, a look back into the 19th and 20th centuries shows a picture of ethnic, racial, and religious diversity as well. The 1840 census (in which West Hartford was included in the Hartford figures), the population included Irish, German, French, and Swedish immigrants. Patrick McCabe, Patrick Martin, and James Riley were all petitioners in 1854 to make West Hartford a separate town. None, though, were among the first office holders in the new town. The Irish presence in the 1840s, however, did not translate into much religious diversity at that point. In fact, it wasn’t until 1918 that the first Roman Catholic Church, St. Brigid opened in town. This church was a mission chapel of the St. Lawrence O’Toole Church just west on New Britain Avenue in Hartford. Today St. Lawrence O’Toole holds services in Vietnamese on Sundays. A look at the birth records of the town from 1885 to 1899 reveals quite a diverse population before the turn of the twentieth century. Irish, English, Swedish, and French Canadians are the ancestries most listed. A look at the death records for the same time period reveals mostly native born and Irish. Other anecdotal evidence appears as well. In a letter which described registering men between the ages of 18 and 46 for the war on September 12, 1918, three interpreters were present: N.C. Casciano, Italian, Bernard Caya, French, and Malcolm Swanson, Swede. In 1918, West Hartford’s population stood at about 8,000, and there was a need for interpreters in three different languages. By 1919, Swedes bought property on Park Road near Oakwood Avenue for $1,000 to build a chapel seating 200. The structure was built mainly by men from the church. In 1921 the West Hartford Ladies were organized into an auxiliary and by 1941, they had worked long enough and hard enough to pay off the mortgage. The Swedes were active in the Boy Scouts and they built a cabin for the troop near Mountain Road in the area around Spice Bush Swamp. Very quickly the West Hartford Chapel had to be enlarged because the Sunday School grew so rapidly. Even today, the legacy of this large group of Swedish immigrants remains in the Park Road area. You can still buy Swedish sausage and bread at Hall’s market. A.C. Petersen’s and Youngstrom’s Floor Covering are still going concerns. But, today if you drive down Park Road, you will see a distinct Asian presence with a Vietnamese and a Chinese market, and Pho Tuong Lai, a Vietnamese restaurant. In 1936, Congregation Beth Israel moved from Hartford to 701 Farmington Avenue. Jews began to move from Hartford’s north end to West Hartford in the mid 1920s. Abraham Feldman had been the rabbi of the congregation since 1925. When he came to Hartford, there were about 200 families at the temple. When he retired in the early 1970s, his West Hartford congregation had over 1,400 families with more than 1100 children in the religious school. Feldman, in an oral interview in 1974, remembered West Hartford as being a closed community politically. He believed it was “the most Republican town in the United States.” Feldman related that there was “no chance for a young Jew, or a Jewish lawyer… to enter the political life of the community.” He said this was also true for Catholics. Feldman related a story he had with a town chairman of one political party in town at the dedication of the Universalist Church in town in 1931. Feldman said the chairman asked him point blank, “What do you want?” He replied, ”There isn’t a damn thing I want from you… I have never come to ask you to appoint a Jew, to give a job to a Jew, or to do anything else for a Jew. But heaven help you if I ever get a report that you have denied a job to a man because he was a Jew.” The Catholic population had been in town longer than the Jews, but still the Protestants controlled the town politically until the 1960s when Democrats got elected more frequently. In the 1970s and 1980s Sandy Klebanoff, Beverly Greenberg and Lonnie Brick led the Town Council and Board of Education. How has the town reacted to these changes? It seems like the economy changes first. The various ethnic and racial groups establish businesses and through that become a part of the community. It seems as though it takes at least another generation to get political representation. The newer migrants to West Hartford – Asians, Hispanics, and a larger group of African Americans – have only begun to test the political waters in town. The first Asian, Naogan Ma, who serves on the Board of Education, is a Republican. Today’s elected officials reflect the ethnic diversity of second and third generation migrants from the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. Present members of the Town Council and Board of Education represent the Irish, Italian, French Canadian, and Jewish migrants of two or more generations earlier. Though the housing stock in town has changed little since 1970, those who live in those houses have changed, not so much in their economic backgrounds as in their ethnic and racial makeup. In a real democracy, the town government should reflect those changes, but using the past as a yardstick, without any direct recruiting and encouragement, it may take another generation. Remembering Romanta Seymour and 19th Century Agriculture Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, April 2010 In 1850, if you stood on the ridge that is South Main Street where it meets New Britain Avenue, cleared fields, pastures, and woodlots would surround you. You might see a grist mill to the east along Trout Brook and the South District one-room schoolhouse to the west. If you traveled down the hill toward Elmwood Center, you could find Romanta Seymour’s farm. In October 1850, the Hartford County Agricultural Society awarded West Hartford’s Romanta Seymour second prize in a contest for the best-cultivated farm in the county. Seymour won $15 for his farm production, which made a 19 percent profit over the 1850 growing season. By 1815, competition with western farms began the switch for New England farmers from wheat and meat production into dairy farming and vegetable production. Transportation improved over the next 35 years, allowing local farmers to more easily sell their surplus. The Hartford-New Haven Railroad line opened through Elmwood in 1839. Agricultural societies and fairs flourished under state aid. Farmers began to use more scientific methods to increase their yields and the agricultural societies supported these efforts. The Hartford County Agricultural Society was incorporated in October 1817. While the industrial revolution in textiles began during this period of time, agricultural production continued to drive the U.S. economy. The value of agricultural goods increased more than 100 times between 1810 and 1880. West Hartford farmers were part of this growth in production. Romanta Seymour’s house lot of 50 acres was on the south side of the old Farmington Road, now known as New Britain Avenue. The entire front of his property was lined by a white picket fence, according to the agricultural society, “giving a pleasant and comely appearance.” In 1847, Romanta Seymour passed the farm’s management to his son William, who actively worked to increase the cultivation and production of the land. According to Seymour, the field produced a large hay crop without any manure and only a light top dressing of ashes. He planted grass seed in two small patches and its yield increased so much that he thought he would do that more in the future. His fields produced between two and three tons of hay to the acre. The average farm produced between three-quarters and one ton per acre. Seymour probably planted about one quarter of his acreage in hay. The pasture at the end of the ravine that ran through his farm had not produced much under his father’s cultivation. However, William plowed the tract and the improvement raised yields by 50 percent. He bought a section in the southeast part of his farm, which was covered with white birches and bushes so thick that even the cattle could not get into the area. In the past three years, Seymour “subdued it” to get in a crop of buckwheat. Buckwheat, not related to wheat, grows best in a low-fertility, acidic soil. Today buckwheat is eaten as soba noodles, porridge and kasha. The grain grows quickly and is used as a second crop in the season, especially where the growing season is short. Some farmers use buckwheat as a cover crop because it grows and establishes itself quickly and keeps out weeds. Seymour’s crop netted him $50 in 1850. According to the agricultural society, this land would soon turn into “handsome meadow ground producing hay in abundance, adding more than 100 percent to its value.” Seymour’s intensive use of the land through his “untiring industry” was a major factor in winning the agricultural prize. Seymour owned 12 acres of land across the street to the north of his house. On this patch, he had three acres in pasture and the rest in grass and corn. The agricultural society commented on Seymour’s use of manure. He had large stalls with abundant straw. With some of last year’s manure remaining in the bottom to act as yeast, he was able to accumulate a good batch of manure. His animals produced 200 loads of manure annually, all of which Seymour plowed in for crops. Even though by 1850 many New England farms had switched to dairy, it is unclear how many cows Seymour kept, but he did raise hogs and turkeys. He started an orchard by planting young apple trees that in 1850 were growing “luxuriantly.” He grew strawberries and had beehives and grew 11 different crops. Seymour’s income also included pasturing a neighbor’s two cows and a calf for $21 and labor done off the farm garnered $72. He grew crops to consume directly, but also marketed some. According to former Town Historian Nelson Burr, rye was in great demand; West Hartford had a prosperous distilling business. Elmwood’s Ebenezer Faxon specialized in distilling and selling rye. The Goodman family distilled rye, corn, barley and cider. Mountain Road and Still Road had five distilleries and Gin Still Hill had three. The Connecticut River Valley also grew into a center of broom making and Seymour’s broomcorn would have fed this industry. His hay and corn were most likely fed to animals. Seymour’s expenses included $160 for his own labor and $180 for hired labor. He bought ashes and plaster worth $47 and seeds for $25. His 19 percent profit for his work added up to $757 and led his farm to be recognized in Hartford County. In 1850 West Hartford, farming dictated the rhythm of life. The fields, barnyard, garden and household ruled the lives of young and old from April to November. But farming changed with the market, just as manufacturing did. Farmers like William Seymour were moved by supply and demand, using their acreage to make the highest profit, and experimenting on plants, animals and insects to insure a good income. To be a good farmer in 1850, farm owners had to change with new technology, markets, transportation and crops. Seymour’s willingness to take risks on his farm led the Hartford County Agricultural Society to honor him. In so doing, the society encouraged others to step out of the traditional ways and experiment, not unlike those in the industrial sector. West Hartford Moves to Payson, Illinois Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, December 2012 This building was erected by Henry M. and Lucy W. Seymour In memory of their only son CHARLES 1912 Jeff Zanger, principal of the Payson Seymour Elementary School, Payson, Illinois, assures me that this bronze plaque is still in the “beautiful marble foyer of our building. It is the first thing you see when you walk through our front doors.” West Hartford descendants of the first settlers of Payson funded this high school building in 1912 and named it after the Seymour family. One of the original Charles Seymours lived in the West Division of Hartford during the American Revolution and served in the local militia. His son, Martin Seymour moved to Payson in 1838 and his grandson Henry built the high school. West Hartford’s connection with this town of 1,026 people dates back 180 years. According to William H. Hall in his History of West Hartford (1930), “in 1833, Albigence Scarborough, a prominent citizen of West Hartford, rode on horseback to the far-off state of Illinois, for the purpose of prospecting with reference to the establishment of a new settlement there.” Scarborough, like so many others, believed that life could be better out west; his new settlement in Payson is a story of the transplanted, a move which made him adapt to the geography of Illinois, and brought much from New England. A 1919 book, the History of Payson and Plainville, IL, claimed that Payson had “some of the richest lands” in its location just five miles east of the Mississippi River, just south of where Missouri, Iowa and Illinois meet. In the 1830s, many farmers from Connecticut and Massachusetts moved west as land became scarce and word of the fertility of western land filtered east. Scarborough, it seems, walked “much of the way, in order to save the strength of his mule to carry provisions” on his first trip in 1833. He must have found the location satisfactory as he returned to West Hartford in 1834, packed up his family and belongings in a wagon to returned to Illinois. Deacon Albigence Scarborough purchased the land on which Payson now stands and in the spring of 1835 laid out the village in a grid, having it mapped and recorded. Scarborough followed the pattern of New England towns by setting a commons in the center. With two other settlers, he laid out and sold lots in late summer 1836, and four acres of land were given by Deacon Scarborough upon which to build a school. Scarborough named the town after Edward Payson (1783-1827), a Congregational minister from Portland, Maine who preached during the Second Great Awakening. Scarborough admired Payson, a man who read Jonathan Edwards and preached with “the eloquence of truth spoken in love.” Payson preached in Maine and in many pulpits around New England and Scarborough must have heard him. Scarborough acted on his faith and helped to build a Congregational Church in 1839 but even before it was dedicated, it burned down. A second church, smaller than the first, was built right away. The Congregational Church was the second church in town, following the Baptist Church in 1834. In 1836 the Methodists formed a religious society as well. Deacon Scarborough planted the first apple orchard in the spring of 1838. He bought the trees in St. Louis. A few years later he planted peach trees which produced some of the best peaches around. By 1835 a new migrant from New York opened the first store in Payson. By 1837, two merchants set up shop and one became the first postmaster. Scarborough helped fund and build the first parsonage in 1845. Scarborough had the help of the Mormons in his endeavor. They were hounded out of Nauvoo, a town just 60 miles north where Mormon leader Joseph Smith was killed in 1844. Most of these refugees made their way to what became Salt Lake City by 1849, but in the meantime, some stopped in Payson and helped Deacon Scarborough. In the late 1830s, many other West Hartford residents moved to Payson. According to Hall, Moses Spencer left his farm on Farmington Avenue just west of the center and took his wife and nine children there in 1839. In 1930, his descendant was one of the largest landowners in Payson. Charles Whitman, Cyrus and Wells Butler, and Martin Seymour with his wife and nine children all travelled to Payson. Seymour owned a 100 acre farm on the present site of the American School for the Deaf in West Hartford; in Payson he managed a limestone quarry. Payson quickly distinguished itself as a place to get a good education. This was unusual for the frontier, but the West Hartford settlers seemed to take responsibility. When Scarborough sold the first land in Payson village, he took 20 percent of each sale price and donated that money to education in the town. Before there were enough students for a public school, many were educated in private schools. The first was in an old log cabin with a roughly finished timber floor on the northeast corner of Edwards and Fulton streets. Miss Emily Scarborough, probably Albigence’s daughter, taught students at this school and later became the first public school teacher. In 1916, Henry M. Seymour, a grandson of Martin Seymour, one of the founders of the town, donated one of the finest school buildings in the west. He gave the building in memory of his only son who was killed at age 16 playing baseball on the school playground and commemorated his son with the aforementioned bronze plaque. The five West Division families that settled Payson in the 1830s brought material goods and values with them. While the geography of Payson, near the Mississippi River may have changed something of their daily lifestyles, their priorities stood the test of time. The idea of common land, and the importance of an education were key parts of 19th century New England settlements that descendants carried on in both towns. "],
["an-independent-town.html", "An Independent Town Democracy in the Mid-19th Century When Abraham Lincoln Came to Hartford The Town’s Role in the Civil War West Hartford’s First Foray with Regionalism Elmwood’s Industries The Story of Vanderbilt Hill Who was William A. Burr? Who was Burdett Loomis?", " An Independent Town Democracy in the Mid-19th Century Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, December 2000 What did freedom and independence mean for the new town of West Hartford in its first decade? How did democracy take shape in this town of about 1,200 Americans in the 1850s and 1860s? Democracy here was contentious and bipartisan. The 153 men who petitioned to the General Assembly for independence in 1854 argued that with a population of more than 1,200 and a Grand List of more than $20,000, it was as large as most of the towns in the state. The 95 men who presented a petition to the General Assembly opposing independence argued that their business was all transacted in Hartford, the population was not large enough, and the new representatives would increase membership in the already too-large House of Representatives. They thought that their indebtedness for roads and bridges would increase taxes in an independent town. The General Assembly accepted the petition for independence and those who were opposed were brought into the new government. By looking at the town meeting minutes from 1854 to 1863, one gets an idea that this was a highly participatory democracy. By 1860, West Hartford had a population of about 1,200 people. Of that, about 600 were men and of the 600, at most half of them were over 21 and eligible to vote. With about 300 eligible voters, at the first Town Meeting in June 1854, the citizens voted 31 men into office. Jobs included selectmen, grand jurors, constables, treasurer, registrar, fence viewers, pound keepers, haywards, and sealer of weights and measures, indicating the agricultural basis of the town. Later on jobs including school visitors and a board of relief were added. If 31 men out of 300 voters were elected, more than 10% of the voting male population served in elected office, making up almost 3% of the total population. The equivalent today would be 1,800 officeholders in the town for our population of 60,000. Today there are 18 elected town officials (nine on the Town Council, seven on the Board of Education, a Probate Judge, and a Town Clerk). These first officeholders, elected in May 1854, indicate that the townspeople wanted a bipartisan government. Of the 31 men elected to office, 18 signed the petition for independence, eight signed a petition against, and five did not sign either petition. The townspeople quickly mended fences and worked shoulder to shoulder. They met at Town Meetings twice a year, usually in March and October. Between 1854 and 1863, they voted on the candidates, the tax rate (anywhere from 5-7% of assessed value of their property), building roads, establishing a second cemetery and attempting to build a Town Hall. And they argued about all of it. In November 1857, a resolution passed that said no person could speak on one subject more than twice or for more than 10 minutes. In 1858 as the town tried to separate itself from the power of the Congregational Church, citizens debated who should take care of Goodman Green, property of the Church. At first the town voted to take over care of the green from the church and “a committee would be established to grade, fence in, improve the park near the meeting house.” The motion went on to ask that $20 be set aside to pay for these improvements. Then it was amended to have the town take possession of the land. Then it was amended to table the whole idea. Then it was voted to drop the issue indefinitely. The town also attempted to build a separate meeting room so that town meetings did not have to happen in the church. The discussions about this issue began in 1858 and finally in 1863 the town purchased the Congregational Church’s vestry building to serve as a Town Hall. At every meeting during this period of time, citizens debated the roads: where to build, how much to pay workers, how much to pay the highway surveyors ($1.25 per day), where the roads would go, and making the highway district the same as the school district. Collecting taxes must have been troublesome because there was constant mention of how to collect those that were in arrears. The highway surveyors collected the highway taxes separately and citizens were taxed separately for one of the eight school districts in the town. Newcomers to the town were the beneficiaries of this roadbuilding. The 1850 census showed a considerable number of laborers born in Ireland living in town. Laborers were paid about one dollar per day to work on the roads. The labor of these Irish men, many of whom had families here, was much in demand as the town grew. However, there is no evidence that any of these men served in any elected town office during this period of time. Decisions about education also led to protracted discussions. Education was an important foundation of the town and town government. Each of the eight school districts had their one-room schoolhouse. Each hired its own teacher and collected their own school tax. In 1859, the district known as “the commons” (presently the area around Charter Oak School) wanted to join together with the district to its east, in Hartford. The resolution to accomplish this was voted and re-voted over a two-year period until the cross-district school became a reality. Citizens fought over who was in each district and whether one district got more funds than another. In 1860, the town voted to collect taxes as a town and divide them among the districts to equalize the spending. It was not until the 1890s that consolidated schools were built. The town also closely monitored its care of the poor. When it separated from Hartford, one of the stipulations of being an independent town was taking responsibility for the poor. West Hartford chose to do this by providing for the poor citizens in their place of residence. The town provided firewood, food, medical care and clothing for those in need. But the town was also circumspect about its money. It paid medical bills of $1.25 to Dr. Wells and Dr. Brace, but then made a resolution that the town would not make another payment of that amount of money unless it was approved by the selectmen ahead of time. A resolution passed in October 1856 said that a particular woman, Sarah Cadwell, could receive no more aid until it was proven she was a pauper of the town. It was rare for events outside town to impinge on the town meeting, but the Civil War certainly did. At the March 1861 meeting, the town voted to pay a bounty of $30 for every man who enlisted. It voted to pay five dollars in money or goods and services to any resident family whose son or husband went to war. West Hartford’s fledgling democracy in the 1850s and 1860s deliberated and exemplified the idea of civic engagement for those landholding men eligible to participate. That these meetings were contentious and bipartisan is a tribute to its citizens and the system itself. When Abraham Lincoln Came to Hartford Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, December 2008. Thanks to Eugene Leach, “Glimpses of Lincoln’s Brilliance,” Hog River Journal, Fall 2005. March 5, 1860. I can imagine a 16-year-old William H. Hall making his way to Hartford in an open carriage. He could have joined a “larger infusion of young men than was usually the case in antebellum political assemblies,” as the New York Times described the crowd, to hear Abraham Lincoln give a speech. Lincoln had not yet been nominated for president; that would come two months later on May 16 in Chicago, but he was looking for a national audience. I want to believe that Hall would have been there based on his political interests. His town of West Hartford had been an independent town for less than six year. The population was about 1,300 people, perhaps 200 families. During the 1850s, the new Republican Party appealed to local voters emphasizing higher education, banking, railroads, industry and cities, and free homesteads to farmers. The Republican Party started as revolt against the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which allowed settlers to vote on whether there would be slavery in their territories. The Republican Party pledged to stop the spread of slavery. In 1858, 136 men voted in the local election, about 85 voting Republican and about 50 voting Democrat. (See Nelson Burr’s From Colonial Parish to Modern Suburb, p. 46.) It is likely that the native born were Republicans and the more recent immigrants including the Irish, German, French, and Swedish listed in the 1850 census were more likely to be Democrats. Hartford, a city of some 29,000 people, was a solidly Democratic town. This might have encouraged the interest in West Hartford’s independence movement in 1854. The first officers in the new town and delegates to the General Assembly were Republicans. On Lincoln’s swing through the northeast, he claimed to be visiting his son Robert at Phillips Academy. But by February, Lincoln clearly had an interest in the presidency. He made a series of speeches in New York, New Hampshire and Connecticut to make himself known nationally, as he was seen as a sectional candidate from the northwest. His most famous speeches were the one given at Cooper Union in New York City and the one given in New Haven, the day after his Hartford speech. Still, the Hartford speech is worth noting. In it Lincoln established himself as a strong opponent of the extension of slavery and slavery itself, even as the Republicans were trying to moderate their stances to show that they were not abolitionists, but instead merely opposed to the extension of slavery. He spoke inside a packed Hartford City Hall on that Monday in March. According to the Hartford Courant, he was “greeted with applause which was almost deafening.” Lincoln used the image of a snake to represent slavery, as he established the Republican focus on banning the extension of slavery. For instance, Lincoln argued: …out in the street, or in the field, or on the prairie I find a rattlesnake. I take a stake and kill him. Everybody would applaud the act and say I did right. But suppose the snake was in a bed where the children were sleeping. Would I do right to strike him there? I might hurt the children or I might not kill, but only arouse and exasperate the snake, and he might bite the children. Thus, by meddling with him here, I would do more hurt than good. Slavery is like this. We dare not strike at it where it is. The manner in which our Constitution is framed constrains us from making war upon it where it already exists. The question that we now have to deal with is shall we be acting right to take this snake and carry it to a bed where there are children? The Republican party insists on keeping it out of the bed. His statement clearly spoke to his audience on the dangers of slavery’s spread. With the focus on the extension of slavery, there are some who argue that it was hard to tell whether Lincoln was against slavery when he took office a year later. He claimed that when the Union entered the Civil War, it was to keep the Union together, not to abolish slavery. Some say his stance was not clear until he issued the Emancipation Proclamation in September 1862 that he was opposed to the institution of slavery. However, at Hartford’s City Hall on March 5, Lincoln declared: …the free states carry on their government on the principle of equality of men. We think slavery is morally wrong and a direct violation of that principle. We all think it wrong. It is clearly proved, I think, by natural theology, apart from revelation. Every man, black, white, or yellow, has a mouth to be fed, and two hands with which to feed it, and bread should be allowed to go to that mouth without controversy. Slavery is wrong in its effect upon white people and free labor. It is the only thing that threatens the Union. This clear declaration denouncing slavery on intellectual and economic grounds pushes the Republican feelings that they had to tread lightly on the topic of slavery or a Republican would not be elected president. Lincoln was clear in his declaration against slavery. The most interesting aspect of his speech was how he tried to find common ground with southerners, highlighting how important economics were in their political decisions. Unlike William Seward, the frontrunner for the nomination, Lincoln did not demonize the southerners. In fact, he found what the two sections had in common: One sixth, and a little more, of the population of the United States are slaves, looked upon as property, as nothing but property. The cash value of these slaves, at a moderate estimate, is $2,000,000,000. This amount of property value has a vast influence on the minds of its owners, very naturally. The same amount of property would have an equal influence upon us if owned in the North. Human nature is the same; people at the South are the same as those at the North, barring the difference in circumstances. Public opinion is founded, to a great extent, on a property basis. What lessens the value of property is opposed, what enhances its value is favored. Public opinion at the South regards slaves as property and insists upon treating them like other property. Lincoln’s claim that “people at the South are the same as those at the North” would have been anathema to abolitionists, and even to Seward, who claimed that those in the South were greedy and amoral, while those in the North were idealistic and righteous. This position was one that echoed through Lincoln’s presidency, including one of his most famous lines found in his second inaugural. “With malice towards none; with charity for all…to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.” Here Lincoln does not distinguish between Union and Confederate people. If William Hall did indeed hear him, he probably would have then proceeded with the crowds led by the Hartford Corner Band, which led Lincoln to the home of his host, Mayor Allyn. He also might have been interested in Lincoln’s meeting with Gideon Welles of Glastonbury at a local Hartford bookstore after his speech. The next year, Welles was appointed Lincoln’s Secretary of the Navy. The Town’s Role in the Civil War Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, August 2005 When the Union went to war with the Confederacy in April 1861, West Hartford had been an independent town for only seven years. Its population stood at almost 1,300. Thirteen men, 1% of the population from West Hartford died in the Civil War. At war’s end, West Hartford had sent 117 men to serve, almost 10% of the population and about half of the male population of military age. The sheer number of men and the newness of the government may have led to fewer records being kept. But, the tally of West Hartford men who served and died in the Civil War (1861-5) probably tells less about West Hartford than any other war. Incentives in the form of bounties led men to move from town to town. West Hartford’s quota of 44 men was oversubscribed by 83 recruits. Many of the 117 were not West Hartford residents. It is more difficult to verify that those who died actually lived in West Hartford. West Hartford men who served were lured by federal, state and local bonuses. Connecticut offered each man $140 for enlisting while they received $27 from the federal government. In May 1861 just one month after the opening salvo at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, West Hartford residents voted at town meeting to borrow $3,000 for war bounties and for the families of soldiers. Male citizens voted for every inhabitant who enlisted in military service for three years to get $30 or its equivalent in equipment and clothing. Families of those who enlisted were paid a monthly amount of up to $5 and $2 for every child under age 12. At first, the town paid this money to all those who enlisted from West Hartford, but within six months, rescinded the amount to those who it was determined did not live in West Hartford. There was much incentive for men to become “bounty jumpers.” They enlisted in one town, got the money, and then deserted. Then they showed up in a second town. Wealthy men were able to “buy” a replacement for $300. Of 20 deserters from West Hartford, it is thought that many were never residents here. The Union’s many advantages made Union recruits believe the war would end quickly. Those who mustered first, signed up for 90 days. There were heavy casualties. The first six West Hartford men who died in 1862 averaged just four months in the army. The Civil War was the last war in which soldiers for the same regiment were mustered from the same town. For instance, at the 1862 Battle of Antietam, the 16th Connecticut Regiment had nine West Hartford men. At this crucial battle in Maryland, the Union Army stopped General Robert E. Lee’s first invasion of the North in September 1862. On the bloodiest battle day, September 17,1862, more than 23,000 men were killed, wounded, and missing. West Hartford’s Edward Deming died on that day. At Antietam, three West Hartford men were killed, four were disabled and two survived to fight another day. Charles Sternberg and Arthur Talcott died of wounds within three months of the battle. West Hartford was thought to have suffered the most of any town its size from this particular battle. In the 1860s, the majority of West Hartford’s population consisted of white Congregationalist farm families. But the town’s population was changing. The 1850 census shows a growing presence of Irish and German immigrants and African Americans continued to live and work here. These demographic patterns were reflected in the Civil War dead and the enlistees. Charles Sternberg, who died at Antietam, was one of four German immigrant brothers who fought in the war. Their father Charles emigrated from Germany in 1854 as a result of the 1848 Revolution. Charles established a farm at the corner of Sedgwick and Mountain Road. One brother William was imprisoned at Andersonville and survived. The 24th Connecticut Regiment included three Irish companies one of which came from Hartford and West Hartford. West Hartford’s John McCarty, who had been a musician in the Regiment, was sent to the front lines and killed at the siege at Port Hudson, Louisiana in the second assault on June 14, 1863. Port Hudson was a pivotal battle for control of the Mississippi. The siege began on May 23, 1863 and lasted for 48 days. About 30,000 Union troops fought 6,800 Confederates. On the morning of May 27, and again on June 14, the Union army launched assaults against the earthworks protecting Port Hudson. McCarty sacrificed his life in the second assault. Finally, the Confederacy surrendered on July 9th, seven weeks later. Once the men got to battle, there were many deserters. In light of the conditions in the Union Army, it is not surprising that desertion was so rampant. It is thought that over 200,000 deserted over the course of the war. The daily hardships of war, lack of weapons, and forced marches which sometimes made straggling a necessity for less vigorous men, caused some to desert. West Hartford’s John Hall mustered and served but died by a military execution for deserting. The military used men like Hall as examples to try to reduce the number of deserters. West Hartford’s Thomas Wells wrote a letter to his family in 1862 claiming to march 20 miles per day, sometimes in the pouring rain, with only a cup of coffee as nourishment.1 J.G. Butler wrote that the army made it hard for soldiers to keep a high morale. Butler marched 300 miles in seven days.2 The horrors of the Civil War were made real to West Hartford residents through the first war photographs, letters, and returning men. In R. H. Morse’s letter to West Hartford’s Mrs. Elizabeth Sisson, 23 July 1863, he wrote “Only three short weeks before, our regt. left Hartford with over one thousand brave men ready to strike a blow for liberty and restore our glorious union once more… Only those who have seen it or have been engaged can tell one half the scenes of horror or carnage of the battlefield. Imagination fails to conceive the one half of it.”3 West Hartford men’s Civil War experiences show their willingness to join for a common cause and of a town to support them. Not everyone enlisted for the same reasons and their fighting situations varied greatly. Some could well articulate the purposes of war and some fought for bounties. The local history becomes more meaningful and complex when intertwined with state and federal policies and world immigration patterns. West Hartford’s First Foray with Regionalism Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, December 2006 An 1869 map of West Hartford shows an aqueduct running from a small reservoir #1 down Farmington Avenue into West Hartford center then on to Hartford. This first reservoir, authorized by the Hartford Water Board in 1866, flooded 32 acres of West Hartford land. But West Hartford residents could not drink the water from the sheet iron pipes coated with cement. It bypassed the town to serve the city of Hartford, which by 1860 had 30,000 inhabitants, to West Hartford’s 1,200. The aqueduct was the beginning of a regional solution to a regional need. In 1857, the Water Board in Hartford realized the city needed to provide more water to its inhabitants. Its population had more than doubled since 1850, and there was not enough potable water in the Hog or Connecticut Rivers. A report by the Water Commission in 1860 recommended that the supply of water should come from the hills west of the city and make its way by gravity, through pipes, to Hartford. Trout Brook seemed to be the perfect source for this water. Hartford’s 1856 petition to the General Assembly to get water from West Hartford was finally granted. The Water Board acquired the pasture land and woodland on the north side of Farmington Avenue that we now know as the MDC reservoir. There was some resistance in West Hartford to the reservoir system. Residents of the newly independent town of West Hartford (1854) did not take well to Hartford damming the brook which also brought their 1200 residents not only clean water, but a source of power for its grist and saw mills. An organized protest of West Hartford mill owners and citizens with water rights, however, was not successful. Resident William H. Seymour and 400 West Hartford citizens showed their support for the project by presenting a petition to support the reservoir project. In 1866, Hartford’s City Engineer began construction of the 53 foot high dam which held back 145 million gallons of water, 260 feet above the Connecticut River. The first water reached Hartford in January 1867. Many West Hartford residents living along Farmington Avenue felt that they should be able to drink the reservoir water as the pipe went right by their houses. In a legal proceeding, West Hartford argued that because the water came from West Hartford territory they should get it for free. West Hartford citizens felt that the possession of the water outweighed the cost of the pipes. The courts decided that they could access the water, but had to pay the same rate as the people in Hartford. Just eight months after the dam was completed, torrential September rains broke a portion of the dam, and the wall of water flooded across Mountain Road, on to Fern and North Main streets, carrying away three bridges. The water deposited stones and gravel on farm land and destroyed fences. The City of Hartford paid $12,000 in damages to the town for the damaged roads and bridges and over $17,000 to individual farmers and mill owners for damages. It took almost three years to rebuild the dam. They opened reservoir No. 2 in 1868, No. 3 in 1875, No. 4 in 1880, and No. 5 in 1884, and No. 6 in 1896. As soon as the Farmington Avenue electric trolley was built past the reservoir in 1894, the reservoir became an even bigger destination for walking, picnicking and “pleasure riding.” By 1930, the reservoir area comprised 1,625 acres of land or about three square miles of West Hartford’s 22 square miles. In 1929, the regional governing body, the Metropolitan District Commission was established with seven member towns including Hartford, Windsor, Wethersfield, Newington, Bloomfield, East Hartford, and Rocky Hill. By the 20th century, as West Hartford developed, the cleanest water was found even farther west in Barkhamsted and in New Hartford. By 1930 as is true of today, our water no longer came from the West Hartford reservoirs, but residents wanted to be sure the three square miles remained as open space for recreation in the town. In the twentieth century this land has been used as a treatment facility for the water from Barkhamsted. West Hartford’s facility near Reservoir No. 1 and Bloomfield’s facility near Reservoir No. 6 treat an average of 55 million gallons of water daily. The facilities treat all of the drinking water provided to MDC customers. Today portions of Glastonbury, East Granby, South Windsor, Farmington and Portland use MDC water but are not members of the Commission. About 400,000 people get water from the MDC in 2006. West Hartford did not become a voting member of the MDC until the last quarter of the 20th century. In 1981, Republican Mayor Chuck Matties encouraged the town to join the Metropolitan District Commission. With rising rates in the early 1980s, Matties felt that West Hartford should have a say on the Board. This was not necessarily a popular stance to take because people in town often worried about being involved in a regional solution. But Matties led the charge to join the other seven towns in the District. With the Town Council split 5-4, and his Republican caucus divided on the issue, he and two other Republicans joined two Democratic council members to join the Board. A follow up referendum passed overwhelmingly by the voters. In November 2006, voters got a chance to vote on an $800 million improvement to the water system. This referendum was prompted by federal and state mandated regulations to address sewer overflows where water gets into pipes carrying sewage. Damages from the 2005 rains that caused sewer overflows in Elmwood have finally been settled. But now the Commission has to take on this regional maze of pipes which carry both clean water and sewage and the cost is high. The 15 year project has an estimated price tag of $1.6 million, with the first phase estimated at $800,000. While many of us believe water should be free, the cost of maintaining pipes today is just as much of an issue as in the 1860s when West Hartford residents were told that water is no longer free! Elmwood’s Industries Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, July 2001 West Hartford has the reputation of being an upscale inner ring suburb. Many of its residents live here and work in Hartford. But, since the 19th century, West Hartford has had an industrial base that differentiates it from suburbs that are solely residential. Those businesses and their workers add to the stability of our town. The first Industrial Revolution in the United States began in the 1820s with canals, textile mills, and the growth of the market economy. West Hartford’s residents bought ready-made cloth and products that came from around the world. Until the 1850s, the main industries in the West Division were grist mills, distilleries and blacksmith shops. The individually owned mills were tied to the only source of power –- water – until the mid-19th century. West Hartford’s largest early industry was the Goodwin Pottery. The Goodwins began their business in 1798, before the railroad came. The West Division had excellent clay deposits and the company produced earthenware jars and containers sold throughout New England. The jugs the Goodwins produced also served the town’s local distilleries. Fires plagued the pottery works, but after the second one in 1867, the Goodwin sons bought land south of New Britain Avenue where the present Abbott Ball Company stands, just west of the railroad tracks of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railway Station that had been built in 1839. By the end of the 19th century, the Goodwin Brothers diversified their line of earthenware to offer terracotta objects with ornate designs for outdoor and indoor decoration. They also made fine china. The market for these goods encompassed the span of the railroads, so became nationwide. The Goodwins developed a large market for their products and soon their industrial site took up ten acres. By the beginning of the 20th century, they employed over 75 workers. Their workers may have included some of the immigrants who had moved to town. By the 1860s, a sizable number of Irish and Germans lived here. With the railroad, the Goodwins hired salesmen to replace their traveling peddlers. These men sold the Goodwin’s wares all over the eastern United States. In 1908, a fire destroyed the wood frame factory. By then, H. Burdette Goodwin, who was in his 60s, decided not to rebuild the factory because of competition from other container makers. The Providence and Fishkill Railroad (later the New York, New Haven and Hartford), whose tracks ran through the southeast section of town, changed the nature of the small farm town, by the 1850s. Industry grew up around this new transportation route and allowed for increased trade to distant points. After the Civil War, the second Industrial Revolution based on heavy industry like steel grew in the northeast. Hartford became the machine tool capital of the country, and West Hartford’s industries were a result of this industry. With the factories came immigrants. By the late 1800s, Scandinavians and Italians moved to town. In the 1870s, Hartford boomed economically; it was dubbed the wealthiest city in America. Industries in Hartford grew and prospered, built to a certain degree on the profits of Colt’s Manufacturing. By the turn of the century, as the insurance companies began to grow, there was little industrial land left for expansion. West Hartford had land available In 1891, Whitlock Coil Pipe Company moved to South Street along the railroad tracks. In 1913, the New Departure Company moved to West Hartford from Bristol. The company made push-button doorbells and ball bearings for the growing automobile industry in Hartford. Whitlock Coil &amp; Pipe Company moved to West Hartford in 1892 and was West Hartford’s first big factory. Founded by 35 West Hartford men, Whitlock made products that transferred heat through bent pipe and tubing. They specialized in a feed water heater that connected to steam boilers. President Charles Edward Beach from 1898 into the 1920s also owned Vine Hill Farm, a dairy farm, much of which is now Beachland Park. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. Like many industries of its day, New Departure built something of a company town by buying a large tract of land between Woodlawn Street and Newington Road. The company divided it into 100 lots and sold them to employees at low prices. This allowed workers to live close to their jobs. These industrial workers who owned their own homes had a real stake in the town and added to the stability of the neighborhoods in the southeastern section of town. During World War I, employment at New Departure grew from 200 to 1,200 in a matter of a year. The contracts for war materiel added workers and profits. In 1910, West Hartford’s population stood at about 4,800, and grew to 8,000 by 1920. In 1912, Abbott Ball Company moved to the old Goodwin Potter site from Hartford. Abbott began producing steel balls and became one of the largest producers of deep-hardened and tempered carbon steel ball bearings. Many of these ball bearings were made for the auto industry in Hartford. In 1954, the founding family still owned Abbott Ball and employed 105 workers. They produced ball bearings for cars, conveyors, and lazy susans. In 2001, Abbott Ball employed a few more workers than 50 years before and was the 14th largest employer in West Hartford. In 1919, Spencer Turbine moved to West Hartford. Wiremold arrived in 1929 and continues its manufacturing after being bought out by LeGrand in 2000. It continues to be one of the town’s largest taxpayers. In 1939, Pratt &amp; Whitney Machine Tool factory moved to the site of the old Charter Oak Race Track. This was the largest industrial site in West Hartford. By the late 1950s, Chandler Evans, Colt’s, and Pratt &amp; Whitney Machine Tool shared the site. In 1954, the three companies employed 5,000 people. Since 1970, industrial production in West Hartford has slowed and commercial and retail sales have grown. But the blue-collar workers in Elmwood’s factories played an important role in the town’s growth. While the owners, financiers, and middle class commuters often have a high profile in town, these industrial workers also help define our suburb. The Story of Vanderbilt Hill Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, March 2004 In a recent class, I asked my students if they had ambition. Do you expect, I asked, to live in a house larger than that of your parents? At least three-quarters of the students answered yes. I wondered at the pressure that put on them, and when the size of houses and rooms in houses would ever level off. Then I remembered the Vanderbilt Mansion. In the mid 1870s, Cornelius Vanderbilt decided that his son, Cornelius, Jr. should have a mansion and that its location should be West Hartford. The mansion was to be built on a 75 acre farm at the peak of Farmington Avenue, across from Whiting Lane. Vanderbilt selected and bought this site in the late 1850s after he had surveyed prospects for the New Haven Railroad and the Providence &amp; Fishkill railroad having routes through West Hartford. Mark Twain called Hartford the richest city in the world, and New York City was building its reputation as the center of commerce and culture in the United States. West Hartford was but a farm town. The population in 1880 stood at just over 1,800, and the town had been independent from Hartford for only 25 years. No doubt the town was beginning to change with farmers specializing in dairy, and an increase in the number of immigrants, but wealth even on the scale of the most scorned Vanderbilt son hadn’t really been seen before in the town. Cornelius Vanderbilt (1794-1877) first made his money when he monopolized ferry service and then shipping on the Hudson River. By the mid-19th century, he invested in the luxury liner business and then by 1857 in railroads, eventually taking control of the New York and Harlem Railroad, and the New York Central. He built Grand Central Terminal in New York City and employed thousands of men during the Depression which began in 1873. Vanderbilt had two sons, and eight daughters. Young Cornelius never lived up to his father’s expectations and was sent off to live in a modest farmhouse on what is now known as West Hill, the same hill on which his mansion was built. His father bought the 75 acres in 1857 from the Hamilton family. Cornelius, Jr. hated every minute he was away from New York City. While living in West Hartford, young Cornelius went into debt. When his father died in 1877, he thought his money problems were solved. However, Vanderbilt left his son William $95 million dollars, his eight daughters split four million dollars, and Cornelius received just $12,000 a year. Cornelius, Jr. tried to use the money to break his father’s will. This gave him some ability to borrow money to build what he called his “dream house” on Vanderbilt Acres. He borrowed half the price of the $60,000 house, a fortune at the time, for this area, but only a small amount compared to his father’s and brother’s mansions in New York City. Cornelius hired architect John C. Meade to design a 27 room house on Farmington Avenue. Meade designed a four story tower mansion with a view of Hartford and the valley to the west. The mansion’s cupola rose five stories high. The central hall was wide enough for a horse and buggy to turn around in. The mansion had a veranda on three sides. The brownstone wall and entrance are the only things left from the house, setting it off from Farmington Avenue But, Cornelius had no luck breaking the will, and thus was stripped of his West Hartford house and land. Meanwhile, sympathetic friends bought it and sold it back to him for $1. However, Cornelius never lived in the house. He committed suicide in 1882. His desire to “live like a Vanderbilt” never happened. The house was auctioned off to a real estate speculator and stood empty for six years, while a caretaker kept it up. Ira Dimock, a rich Hartford silk manufacturer and inventor bought it in 1888 and lived there. In May 1917, his wife died in the house and he died a week later at age 90. In the midst of World War I, no one felt capable of taking care of the house, and it was torn down in 1918. Ira Dimock, a silk manufacturer, owned and lived in the Vanderbilt mansion from 1888 to 1917. His son Irving Dimock died in the Spanish American War of typhoid fever in a camp training to go fight. Another son, Stanley Dimock teamed up with Horace Grant to tear down the family mansion in 1918 and establish the West Hill neighborhood with 25 homes. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. Dimock’s son Stanley Dimock and Horace Grant, a Hartford manufacturer, developed the Vanderbilt Hill area after the mansion was torn down. The houses Dimock built were smaller than the house he had grown up in. The two men made sure that the 25 homes built were all single family with garages. The developers approved each architect who designed the houses and made sure that each one cost at least $10,000. The development became the first to put electric lines underground. The first house, completed in 1920, stood on the site of the Vanderbilt Mansion. Both Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr. and Stanley Dimock built and lived in homes that were smaller than those of their parents. Cornelius would say that his son lacked ambition and his alcoholism sank him into depression. Dimock, on the other hand, chose to make more of the land on which he had grown up by subdividing the land and making a handsome profit. Since 1988, West Hill has been denoted an historic district, representing a new style 1920s suburban neighborhood. The Vanderbilt Mansion was the first of several mansions in town in the 1870s and 1880s. The first wave of suburbanization was not the middle class, but it was the upper class who moved here first. The Russell Mansion, at the corner of Prospect and Cone Street, built in 1874 was four stories. It too has been demolished. The Home of Yung Wing on the corner of Prospect and Fern was demolished as well. The Judd Mansion on Highland still stands, now surrounded by the Hughes Convalescent home. It wasn’t until the 1890s, when the electric trolley came through that developers began to build middle class housing. The ambitions of the wealthy in the 1870s and 1880s could not be sustained by the next generation as witnessed by the number of these mansions that were demolished. Who was William A. Burr? Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, June 2009 W.A. Burr’s name is prominent in the 1896 and 1909 insurance atlas maps of West Hartford’s town center. He owned the land east of South Main Street to Trout Brook along Farmington Avenue. The land surrounding the First Church was bounded by present-day South Main, Burr Street and Raymond Road, and goes east as far as Trout Brook. Surprisingly, Burr is not mentioned in any of the histories written about this town. Yet he clearly had a role in its development from rural town to modem suburb. He was a landowner and an entrepreneur. Burr was born in Hartford where his father, Allen Burr and his grandfather, Thomas Burr, lived before him. Thomas ran the only general store in Hartford on North Main Street, then called Burr Street, near the head of Trumbull Street. William moved to West Hartford with his family when he was five, probably before this town was separate from Hartford. William A. Burr was at first a farmer. In October 1873, a news article proclaimed that Burr could “boast one of the best orchards in the state. Mr. Burr’s orchard has produced 150 bushels of apples and his pear trees have been unusually prolific of choice varieties.” In the 1870s he took his produce and his animals to the Connecticut State Fair near the race track on New Park Avenue. By 1875, Burr had established a hardware store and carriage shop. An 1875 news short claimed that “Mr. W.A. Burr of West Hartford has the agency for the sale of the Tompkins County Self-Tilting Wheel Rake said to be the best wheel rake, seeder and plaster sower combined that there is in the world.” This “Carriage Repository and Hardware Store” stood at the present site of the Noah Webster Library. There were two buildings in his operation in 1896 and 1909. Burr’s success with the sale of new farm machinery was a sign of the increasing industrialization of farming and of his role as entrepreneur. In Burr’s role as businessman and real estate owner, he amassed wealth. He owned a summer vacation home in Branford at Short Beach and a winter home in Ormond, Fla., just north of Daytona Beach. A Hartford Courant article in October 1910 described William A. Burr buying land for a winter residence in Ormond, Fla. The paper claimed it was a time of “remarkable growth of resorts in Florida.” In 1913, the pastor of the Congregational Church, the Rev. Thomas M. Hodgdon, expressed an interest in building a new church and a new parsonage for the growing church. He cited the congestion in the center and the increasing value of the present site for business purposes. Burr delivered. In 1914, according to the Hartford Courant, William A. Burr, most likely a member of the church, donated a strip of land to the First Church of Christ in the center of town. The land was 19 feet on Farmington Avenue by 15 feet deep and ran on the east side of the church. This strip of land straightened the line of the church’s property and allowed the church to provide easy access to the sheds in the back of the church where people stabled their horses. It also allowed them to level the rear lawn and beautify the property. On this 1909 insurance map, note William A. Burr’s land on the corner of Farmington Avenue and Main Street, and on Main and what became Burr Street. Burr owned the Carriage Repository &amp; Hardware Store just south of the Congregational Church and Parish. Sandwiched between was the Masonic Hall. Another piece of his property came to the town to build William Hall High School in 1924. Burr died in 1923. Source: Atlas of the City of Hartford, and the Town of West Hartford, Connecticut: L.J. Richards &amp; Company, Springfield, Massachusetts, 1909, Plate 23. The article claimed that Burr was thinking about running a street along the eastern boundary of the church property from Farmington Avenue to Seyms Street (now Memorial Drive), giving the church a corner on which they could possibly build a chapel. In that same year, the Barker-Tanner Hardware Company bought Burr’s retail business. This was the same year the A.B. Judd Company was incorporated as a druggist and it purchased the building it occupied on the comer of Farmington Avenue and South Main Street. In 1923, right after Burr died, his estate was valued at $112,681 ($1.2 million in 2009 dollars). The real estate on Farmington Avenue was more than half of the total of the estate. He had half a block of frontage on Farmington Avenue just when the Center started to become a retail center. He also owned land on Vera Street to the southeast of the center and two parcels of land on South Main Street, one worth $6,500 and one worth $7,300. He owned four parcels of land along Farmington Avenue. In May 1924, the First Congregational Church bought a tract of land from Burr’s estate south of its property for $59,000. The new tract was between South Main, Seyms Street and a proposed street running from Raymond Road to Seyms (the current Isham Road). This land helped the First Church survive during the Great Depression in the 1930s, as it was sold to the town to build the Town Hall and library. These building projects, along with other development in the Center, helped define the burgeoning suburb. South Main Street from Farmington Avenue to Burr Street was the scene of much building activity by 1924. The population had grown to 9,000 and residents wanted to be able to take care of their needs without going in to Hartford. The Masonic Temple was under construction on the west side of South Main Street. Hall High School was in mid-construction. The town was prepared to move two houses from the Hall High site to make way for the school. The West Hartford Trust Company site was being readied for the first bank in town. Burr’s land sale, after his death, provided an important opening for economic growth as well as the placement of public buildings in the town center. Burr Street stands as a reminder of a man who successfully navigated the change from farm town to suburb through his real estate and business acumen. Who was Burdett Loomis? Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, March 2008 Farmington Avenue is once again getting a makeover, and it seems like a good time to look back at the work of Burdett Loomis who led improvements on that Avenue in the 1870s, over 130 years ago. Burdett Loomis, (1838-1919) was a businessman and entrepreneur whose vision helped transform West Hartford from a farm town to suburb. Loomis was an inventor, patent holder, and manufacturer of gas plant machinery and a citizen who “planned ahead for Hartford and West Hartford” according to a 1912 Hartford Courant news article. The 1912 article was prompted during improvements-in-progress on Farmington Avenue that year. Prospect and Farmington were each a standard three rods (48 feet) across and Loomis wanted to widen them to 75 feet. By 1873, Loomis owned the land bounded by Farmington Avenue, Prospect, Fern and Vanderbilt Hill, now West Hill. Loomis was married in 1859 at age 21 and moved to Hartford in 1871. He first lived on Wethersfield Avenue in Hartford and in 1873, built what became known as the Russell Mansion on Prospect Avenue. This house had ornamental woodwork and a stately tower. It stood on the west side of Prospect near Cone Street, close to where the Bristow Middle School is today. It has since been torn down. Loomis seems to have lost his first fortune as a result of the panic of 1873, so was forced to sell the mansion, and in 1878, he moved north to 837 Prospect Avenue just south of Elizabeth Park, on the West Hartford side to a more modest home built in 1845. When Loomis first moved to Prospect, he believed that Farmington Avenue would be “one of the finest thoroughfares out of Hartford” into West Hartford, Farmington and further west. Loomis also believed that Prospect Avenue should be wider and when Loomis asked Hartford to share in widening the street from 48 to 75 feet, the city refused to take land from the Hartford side even though no houses had been built there. Loomis reduced the grade of the avenue for about 1/3 of a mile to one inch in every 100 feet. He cut down trees and then planted a row of trees between Farmington and Fern. He spent $1,000 of his own money to widen Farmington Avenue. As the town widened the street, the “Great Panic” –- probably of 1873 –- took over, and he lost most of his fortune. Loomis’ businesses helped West Hartford grow through ingenuity and public utility and transportation systems. Loomis was a part owner of the trolley company. He was instrumental in getting the horse car line extended to West Hartford Center in 1889. Loomis also had a hand in the building of the water pipe system from the reservoir. It first opened in 1867 before he was here, but he worked on getting the pipes laid under the road and accessible to West Hartford citizens. In 1881, at age 43, he organized the Steam Heating Company of Hartford. He soon found problems with the steam heat in that so much was lost in its transmission. He decided to substitute cheap natural gas to heat and invented cheaper methods to make gas, which was soon used for gas engines. From 1886 to 1889, he built the first gas plant that produced gas from coal, wood or lignite and delivered it to its domestic users through pipes laid underground over long distances. His company laid gas lines on the frontier. By 1899, Loomis headed the Loomis Gas Machinery Company in Hartford. His company laid iron pipes for gas and water, both important pieces in building the infrastructure of towns and cities. In 1882, he organized the first Electric Lighting Company in Connecticut. By 1912 he and his son, Burdett Loomis, Jr., served as directors of the Northern Connecticut Light and Power Company. His son was also treasurer of the company. Throughout these years as a developer, Loomis made and lost several fortunes, according to family legend. Probably Loomis’ biggest gamble, and his best fun came when he helped establish Charter Oak Race Track in 1873. Loomis promoted and developed the race track at Flatbush and Oakwood Avenues. In 1876, he planted the elms in the front of the park on New Park Avenue and had the avenue widened. The park became one of the finest trotting courses in the country. Loomis saw his first trotting race on a half mile track on Hartford’s Albany Avenue in 1861. When he relocated to the city, he believed Hartford should have one of the best courses in the country. He chose the site, organized the association, superintended the building of the track, planted the trees and gave the grounds a park-like appearance. Loomis had backing from Charles M. Pond and Governor Morgan Bulkeley. The track drew all the leading harness horses and their drivers. He was Secretary of the Charter Oak Association in 1880. Bets ranged from $100 to $20,000. In 1882, Loomis decided he wanted a special event in Hartford, and he drafted conditions for a $10,000 purse over Labor Day Weekend, one of the largest in the nation. When Loomis proposed the large purse, people thought he would lose money, but Governor Bulkeley, the treasurer of the association guaranteed the race. It made money that year and every year after. That race continued into the 1920s, even after Loomis’s death in 1919. Loomis was one of the seven men who “labored zealously to establish and maintain the “Grand Circuit” of harness racing. This circuit gave light harness racing the prestige that it has maintained to date. Charter Oak Park was on the Grand Circuit until 1925. Burdett Loomis, according to Caroline Church, was one of the men who helped turn West Hartford from a small farming village to a suburb over 100 years ago. In her senior college thesis, which brought Loomis to my attention, she focuses on the role of public improvements, particularly the West Hartford Reservoir system in defining the changing nature of West Hartford from 1870 to 1910. He was certainly a man of his times –- a businessman, an entrepreneur, and a man who wanted to give back to his community. His maxim throughout his life, still rings true today: “to do something for the world and the community, regardless of whether or not [he] was going to reap the benefits derived therefrom.” Something that distinguishes West Hartford from other towns is that there are so many in West Hartford who continue to abide by this maxim.

As it did, its government reacted by regulating construction and by building an infrastructure of bridges, sewers, water mains and paved roads. The population grew from about 1,500 residents who lived on farms, to 9,000 strong as housing developed in the center and along Farmington Avenue. The new, suburban citizens pushed for services that Hartford dwellers already enjoyed. The Noah Webster House and West Hartford Historical Society archive holds many town records that describe these changes. One of them, Special Acts of the General Assembly, 1854-1913, provides a window into the infrastructure growth in town as well as the relationship between local and state governments. Annual Town Reports from 1870 also tell a story of how the town grew. In 1888, when Hiram Hurlburt represented West Hartford, the General Assembly, established a Board of Health in each town. This Board of Health made rules that impacted the town budget and homeowners. It provided instructions for “privy, cesspools, drains and garbage.” This law lead to the town digging sewers. It also established rules for selling food. No carcasses of calf, pig or lamb could be sold here. It also required residents of town to report any cases of croup, scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhoid, typhus, cholera, or yellow fever. The state was ahead of federal regulations as it was not until 1906 that the U.S. Congress passed the Meat Inspection Act. The growing population and hence the growing amount of sewage seeping into Trout Brook, led the General Assembly in 1893 to authorize the town of West Hartford to construct sewers. The town decided where the sewers would go and the local property owners had to pay for the spur that went to their home. They made a deal with Hartford to hook up to their system as well, and to pay Hartford a fee for the hook up. Developer Frederick C. Rockwell was West Hartford’s Representative to the General Assembly when this law was passed. Rockwell had some interest in these sewers as he built the first housing development in town on the Boulevard between Trout Brook and Main Street. He owned the land and began to build houses in the 1890s. After the sewers were built, the next step was, in 1913 to build a sewage disposal plant. In the same year the town got the power to grant building permits. In 1895, the General Assembly made it the duty of the Hartford Board of Water Commissioners to lay connecting pipes and furnish water to the residents in West Hartford who applied and paid for their water. Hartford’s water came from the reservoir in West Hartford, so by-passed the town itself. Adolph Sternberg was West Hartford’s representative to the General Assembly at this time. He was one of nine children of Charles Sternberg, a German immigrant lawyer who, in 1854, came to West Hartford to farm. In 1897, the General Assembly allowed for the town to appoint a Water Commission and establish building lines. It gave the town the power to lay pipes and ask property owners to pay for the pipes that went across their property. In 1903, when Representative G. F. Scarborough sat in the General Assembly, the West Hartford town government got the power to build sidewalks, but at the property owners’ expense. In 1907, Democrat Charles Edward Beach served the town at the General Assembly. Charles Edward was the son of Charles M. Beach, a Hartford businessman who bought land in West Hartford in 1859 and built Vine Hill Farm on the corner of New Britain Avenue and South Main. By 1900, Charles Edward managed the farm. He also was the town surveyor and served as selectman. As a representative at the State House, he helped establish a Special Commission to “inquire into the management of affairs” in town. It seems as though the town had a difficult time collecting taxes. Between 1888 and 1894 the tax collector books were missing. Beach, the only Democrat to serve between 1857 and 1925, seemed to be checking up on Republican politicians who controlled the town. Six years later, in 1913, the town established a Board of Finance to exercise supervision of financial affairs in the town. The following table, which shows the growth in population, budget, and the allocation of funds within that budget, is a window into building the infrastructure of the town. Year Population Budget Highways Streetlights Budget per person 1870 1533 $27,000 10% 0% $18 1880 1828 $34,000 18% 0% $18 1890 1930 $37,000 17% 0% $19 1900 3186 $56,900 15% 0% $18 1910 4808 $150,000 8% 5% $31 1920 8854 $410,000 5% 2% $46 Over 50 years, the amount of money spent in town grew 15 times while the population grew 6 times. The percentage of budget money spent on highways and bridges peaked around 1890. The installation of streetlights occurred over a short period of time. Clearly by 1920, the town provided more services to its constituents. One important piece of the infrastructure, education, became a larger percentage of the budget in the 1920s when seven schools were built: Beach Park, Morley, Smith, and Elmwood elementary schools, Plant and Talcott Junior Highs, and Hall High. After the town built up its infrastructure, it paved the way for more housing developments and attracted many new residents to enjoy the amenities of sewers, piped in water and street lights that had before, only existed in the city. Biking in West Hartford Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, July 2012 In 2012, West Hartford’s Bicycle Advisory Committee meets the second Monday of every month to make West Hartford a more bike friendly town. Bike enthusiasts yearn for bike lanes and safe places to ride on the roads. Twentieth century plans for roads were all about cars; bicyclists are trying to change that. West Hartford’s history as a bike town goes way back to the Charter Oak Race Track well before the “bike craze” of the 1890s. Back then, the bike craze led to athletic competitions, a new way to get to work, a new leisure time activity, and safer roads. In September 1878, two Hartford physicians who purchased Columbia bikes proposed that the Charter Oak Race track add bicycle racing. In May 1879, the Hartford Courant reported that people were talking about a bicycle tournament at Charter Oak Park and that Hartford had some good bicycle riders ready to compete. On June 13, 1879 George W. Pomroy of the Oakwood Hotel gave a purse of $100 [about $2,200 today] for a bicycle race at the Charter Oak Race Track. It was the best two out of three in mile heats. On the Fourth of July 1879, Charter Oak Park sponsored bicycle contests along with horse racing, and a sack race. Mr. G.W. Pomroy at the Oakwood Hotel was particularly active in arranging the bicycle race. The crowd loved the race and pushed Pomroy to set up another race. According to the Courant, “The interest in bicycles is greatly on the increase in Hartford, since their manufacture has begun here at the Weed works, and many young men have become engaged in the use of the machine. A considerable number are very expert in its use, and with more entering a very entertaining race could be arranged.” Albert A. Pope, who founded Boston’s Pope Manufacturing Company, started to import bicycles from England in 1878. Col. Pope wanted bikes to be made in America and so he approached Hartford’s Weed Sewing Machine Company who used interchangeable parts and by the end of September 1878, they manufactured 50 bicycles with the large front wheel. To produce the Duplex Excelsior copies, Weed produced 77 unique parts and the only part that came from a supplier was the rubber tire. Pope dubbed the new bicycle “Columbia.” His use of the hollow tube and ball bearings distinguished his bikes from others. According to an 1878 Hartford Courant article, “Mr. Pope… who resides ten miles from the city [Boston], rides to and from his place daily on one of these vehicles, unless the weather is stormy.” Further, the article stated that the bicycle craze in England had gone on for years and that an amateur rider had ridden a 3 minute 10 second mile. Pope became an enthusiast about bikes at the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition. He started to import bikes from England and took out US patents on the European models. By the early 1890s, he developed a bicycle trust, which controlled all bicycle patents in the United States. For all bikes manufactured in the US he got $10 per bike. By 1881, The Hartford Wheel Club organized monthly races at Charter Oak Park. On Saturday, June 25, 1881, at 3:00 pm, the amateur competitors biked from Capitol Avenue and Washington Street to the park. The 50 bicyclists, including five racers from New Britain were divided into three classes. It was the biggest gathering of bicyclists ever. The winning racer rode the mile in 3:25 from a standing start. The three judges included George B. Day, son of George Day the leader of the Weed Sewing Machine Company that was building the bicycles. In ten years, Pope changed the size of the front wheel to be equal in size to the back and had the rider sit between the wheels. This made the bicycles even easier to ride and democratized the athletic pursuit. The bicycle craze blossomed with this new invention in the 1890s. According to Ellsworth Grant in his article “The Miracle on Capital Avenue,” in the Hog River Journal in 2002, Weed employed 600 men making these “safety” bicycles. In the mid 1890s, Pope lorded over 18 acres of factory space on Capitol Avenue. He employed almost 4,000 people and produced 50,000 bicycles a year. In the summer of 1882, Mr. Hyde of the Charter Oak Park Hotel and Mr. William B. Smith leased Charter Oak Park for the Fourth of July. They offered prizes worth $2,000 for trotting races, bicycle races and foot races. They offered a “shore dinner.” This drawing, originally published in Harper’s Weekly (1885) by illustrator Albert Berghaus, shows the final heat of the one-mile open amateur bicycle race at Charter Oak Park in 1885. Note the crowds of spectators in the covered grandstands and the tall viewing platform to the right. The Connecticut Bicycle Club sponsored this series of races over a two-day tournament. At least 7,000 spectators attended. Source: The Connecticut Historical Society. In September 1884, the Connecticut Bicycle Club mounted a race with prizes of $1,000. Hundreds of people lined the streets for a parade of over 100 bikers. They scheduled 12 races with riders from Hartford, Springfield and Boston. The top racer had a time of 3 minutes 3 seconds. Five thousand people came to the races in the first large-scale bike race West Hartford had seen. Colonel Pope was one of the officials of the races. The Courant reported: Never before in this country has a more successful one day’s tournament been held, and never before in any race in the world has such good time been made as in the mile race… A comparison between such racing and horse racing must necessarily be to the advantage of the former sport, for there was no grumbling on the result of the contest and no boisterous language, and the auditors knew that the struggles they viewed between the race were honest and that the best man always won. According to Pope, the main problem for bicyclists was that there were not safe, macadamized roads to ride. In 1880, he was one of the founders of the “League of American Wheelmen” to lobby local governments for improved roads. The late nineteenth century bicyclists long before the invention of the automobile spurred the “Good Roads Movement.” By the 1890s, much of West Hartford’s town budget was in building hard top roads. Today, bicyclists are back at it, trying to improve the roads for riding. The context has changed dramatically as the gas-powered automobile is the main impetus for improved roads. But bicyclists want car drivers to share the road and allow them to feel safe as physicians once again encourage their patients to bike to keep fit. James Talcott, Merchant and Philanthropist Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, April 2003 As the town plans for a new middle school on the east side of town, I wonder what we’ll call it. How have we named other schools? What does it say about the historical context and about the town’s values? School names can be an interesting source of information about both. Talcott Junior High, on the corner of Quaker Lane and New Britain Avenue opened in 1922. Its opening was part of a reorganization of the town schools as they moved away from both the one room schoolhouse and the kindergarten to grade 8 school. James Talcott (1835-1916), lived in town for 19 years, and was “a successful merchant and member of a family long active in town and school affairs.” He moved to New York City at 19 to become a merchant and lived there until his death at the age of 81. His contact with the town seemed minimal after he left, but his career and public life in New York made him a man to emulate. William Hurd Hillyer, James Talcott’s 1937 biographer, described him as a man who prospered on individual initiative, responsibility, morality, ethics, integrity, honesty, being honorable, kindly and steadfast and having a spirit of cooperation. He tied these values to the Puritan work ethic as well as Talcott’s pure English lineage. These values are part of the civic education public schools try to teach. James Talcott descended from a man who shared the same name and migrated to America with Thomas Hooker in 1632. John Talcott was one of the founders of Hartford with Thomas Hooker in 1636 and Talcott Street in Hartford is named after him. He served as a Court Magistrate, was a Deputy from 1637 to 1652, and was Treasurer of the colony from 1654 to his death in 1660. His son, John Talcott, Jr. succeeded his father as Treasurer of the colony. Another descendant, Joseph Talcott was Governor of Connecticut from 1725 to 1742. Samuel Talcott of West Hartford built a mill near the pottery in 1828 where he and his sons carried on a thriving wool business for years. Talcott’s sheep provided wool for his woolen business. They had a fulling shop where the cloth was made ready for market and stored. The businesses were part of his 1000 acres of land which extended from New Britain Avenue as far as Oakwood Avenue, on the west side of Quaker Lane near where Trout Brook crosses the road. Samuel Talcott’s son Seth took over the mill and he was the father to James (remember him!). As a young man, James and his ox team had the task of bringing goods to market in Hartford. When his brother opened up a woolen knitting mill in New Britain, James got involved at the outset as a merchant. As a man of just 19, he set out for New York City in 1854, and set up shop. This was right when West Hartford became an independent town. In the 1850s merchants were the pillars of capital and lived in the big cities. They were generally the wealthiest men and were civic leaders. As a merchant, James Talcott sold his brothers’ goods to stores like New York’s A.T. Stewart, the biggest retail merchant in the country, and Philadelphia’s Wanamakers, the country’s first department store. He was successful, according to Hillyer, because of his honesty and integrity, and because the knitted woolen goods from this brother’s factory in New Britain were so good. Once established in New York City, James Talcott married Henrietta Francis in 1861. Her uncle had a farm in West Hartford. James probably met her on a Thanksgiving break where he spent a few days every year with his parents in West Hartford. James and Henrietta bought a house at 20 West 39th Street – a four-story brick house. He lived there for 12 years and his three sons J. Frederick, Arthur and Frank were born there. They later had two daughters. Every Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Talcott drove in the family carriage downtown to bring Mr. Talcott home. She never drove to the front of his building on Franklin Street because both she and Mr. Talcott believed that it would have been “unnecessarily ostentatious” for him to step into a fine carriage with a coachman and footman in front of his business. In 1876 they bought a five story brownstone for $90,000 cash at 7 West 57th Street. This was a new and fashionable part of the city which had become so because William H. Vanderbilt and other wealthy New Yorkers had built imposing homes there. But probably more important was the opening of Central Park where New Yorkers could skate, sleigh, ride, drive, and play outdoor games like archery, croquet, and lawn tennis. Talcott had enough money and social standing to be a part of this West Side life. In this home, well staffed with servants, there was a routine. Mrs. Talcott served tea at five o’clock each day. Friends usually came by to visit at this time. Dinner was always served at 7:30 and Mr. Talcott always dressed “in full evening dress” for the occasion whether there were guests or not. He served no wine or liquor, but an imported sparkling mineral water. Talcott showed a deep interest in religion and took an active part in church affairs. Talcott joined the Broadway Tabernacle Church (Congregational) and became a member of the Church Committee at age 30 when, traditionally, this group was made of the elders of the church. He found time for mission work in Bethany Parish at 34th and 10th, in one of the poorest sections of the city. James Talcott was a Republican and he was mentioned as a candidate for Mayor of New York City in 1890, but never ran. He was a protectionist and one of the staunchest supporters of the American Protective Tariff League, a position that most merchants took. He spent time fighting Democratically controlled Tammany Hall. As a philanthropist he gave away 10 percent of his wealth. He saw himself as a steward of his wealth. Some of his interests included a library built at the Northfield School, Massachusetts, a dormitory built at Oberlin College, the Grace Talcott Hospital at Shunteh-foo, China, planting an arboretum at Mt. Holyoke College, and endowing a professorship for religion at Barnard College. He was one of the founders of the Jerry McAuley Water Street Mission, the Cremorne Mission and the Home for Intemperate Men. In 1897, Talcott gave books and money to help establish West Hartford’s free public library. Until then, the library was part of the First Congregational Church. In his later years, Talcott devoted his life to peace. He went to Lake Mohonk, America’s peace center each fall. He supported peace in trade and in politics. Talcott was 80 when war broke out in Europe and he expressed his disapproval. He died peacefully in 1916 at Lake Mohonk, before the U.S. entered the war. The 1920s, the post World War I era, was a time when “the business of America was business.” The town’s population grew to almost 9,000 by 1920, and middle class professionals started to move to West Hartford, the streetcar suburb. James Talcott’s career must have appealed to them because of his monetary success, his moral and ethical purity, and his charitable works. Many other members of the family were involved in West Hartford governmental affairs, but the town officials chose this self-made business leader, this champion of hard work, integrity, honesty and success to be a role model for the town. Elmwood Suburbs Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, June 2011. Thank you to Jeffrey Murray, Conard High School junior, whose research paper, “Elmwood: From Rural Community to Working Class Suburb,” won the 2011 Freeman and Mary Meyer Prize for Excellence in Local History. In the early 20th century, the Elmwood section of West Hartford developed its suburban character on a parallel to West Hartford center’s development. The same ingredients nourished growth in both places: transportation in the form of the trolley, farmers ready to sell their land to developers, real estate developers, and people looking to move out of the city. It all added up to a growth in population and an eclectic mix of residential, industrial, commercial, religious and educational institutions. This mix of buildings and people gives Elmwood the separate identity it retains today. In 1900, when the trolley company laid a track down New Britain Avenue ending at East Street (now Quaker Lane), suburban development picked up. Before the trolley, residents could jump on the steam train running through the southeast corner of town for $24 per year. But in 1899, the train raised the rates to $60 per year and passengers lobbied to bring the trolley to Elmwood. Within a year the line opened. As people moved out of Hartford and New Britain and into West Hartford, government services expanded. In 1900 the town added onto the Elmwood School, built as a two-room schoolhouse in 1888. In 1901, the West End Land Company bought land in Elmwood on the present site of Yale and Florence Streets. Their handbills to sell the properties advertised free trolley. Four years later, F.C. Rockwell who developed the Boulevard in the Center between Main and Trout Brook, sold land on New Britain Avenue to developer Terry Chapin. This land was subdivided by 1909 into more than 60 lots. Wallace B. Goodwin, grandson of Harvey Goodwin, the founder of Goodwin Pottery, a local industry since the early 1800s, began to develop Elmwood with small single-family homes. He wanted to sell lots to people of moderate means. Goodwin also wanted to retain the agricultural nature of the residential area. In an advertisement for “Bungalow Farms,” on Newington Road he wrote, “If you could own your own home with a real little farm, where you could raise your own vegetables and chickens and be in Hartford or New Britain within fifteen or twenty minutes’ ride, now wouldn’t that be ideal?” He sold “acre lots and bungalows” in a “beautiful restricted section.” He added that the lots were “close to Elmwood Trolley and Railroad Stations.” By 1915, Goodwin sold all but six desirable. Wallace B. Goodwin, in the real estate and insurance business, was a direct descendant of the founder of Goodwin Pottery. In 1936 he bought land west of Ridgewood Road to create a development around Wood Pond and Woodridge Lake, once the ice business ended. Source: Display Ad 65, The Hartford Courant, May 24, 1914. Goodwin appeared in the ad, holding a plot of land with a bungalow, set on a country road. In 1913, Goodwin planned to develop an Elmwood that would be distinct from developments in the center of town. Mentioning New Britain in his ad and suggesting that residents could grow their own vegetables were attempts to market a suburban neighborhood with rural charm that differed from the developments in the center of town. On April 25, 1915, the Hartford Courant reported that Goodwin bought land from F.W. Talcott on the east side of East Street for developing this “splendid tract” in a “restricted way.” Goodwin called the area “Burgoyne Gardens.” Houses built on this tract had a view of Talcott Mountain and Charter Oak Park, across Trout Brook from the development. Sewers and piped in water both served this neighborhood. Goodwin had room for about 40 homes on the plot and he planned to build both single and two-family homes. Goodwin’s development was within walking distance of a post office, library, and school with easy access to the trolley and train, which could whisk commuters into Hartford. The post office built in 1873, was a sign that Elmwood had a separate identity from West Hartford, which became independent from Hartford in 1854, just 19 years earlier. Also in 1873 the Elmwood Community Church set up a Sunday school, which met at the Elmwood School. In 1876, this group of Congregationalists built the Elmwood Chapel at New Britain Avenue and Grove Street. In 1926 this church moved to its present location on Newington Road. By the mid 1920s, the population of Elmwood stood at about 2,000. Meanwhile, Wallace B. Goodwin continued to expand his reach from real estate developer to purveyor of insurance on furniture and buildings, mortgages, and selling ready-built sheds to be used as garages. In 1917, the Catholic Transcript reported that the Elmwood church, St. Brigid, was the first Catholic Church to be erected in West Hartford. at. According to the Transcript, “The Town is fast growing and the new church, which is at the southern end, promises one day to be a considerable Catholic center.” The Church started as a mission of St. Lawrence O’Toole Church, in Hartford just about a mile east of Cambridge Street and New Britain Avenue. Elmwood continued to develop its own identity as a working class suburb with manufacturing and farms, and an active political life. The area residents saw themselves as outsiders from those who lived in the town center. In an attempt to get fire protection in Elmwood in 1919, the “Men’s Union” “turned out in full battalion strength” to a special fire district meeting at the Town Hall in the center of town. They hired cars to take them to the town hall and surprised the “unsuspecting townsmen of the north end.” Those running the meeting were met by “a storm of protest.” The Elmwood men got their way when the Fire District voted to give fire hydrants to Elmwood by increasing the mill rate by one mill. The Men’s Union’s next step was to establish their own fire station in town which finally came to fruition in 1919. It was clear that the increased fire protection would add to the value of houses in Elmwood. In 1922, Talcott Junior High opened on land contributed by the Talcott Estate. Talcott and Plant Junior Highs were among the first junior high schools built in Connecticut. Six years later in 1928, as the population in Elmwood grew, the town tore down the Elmwood School and replaced it with the Elmwood Grammar School fashioned after the Beach Park School on Steele Road and the Morley School on Fern Street. The Hartford Courant claimed that this subdivision was “an excellent location for the suburban dweller.” By 1925, those who moved to Elmwood made a choice to live in a community proud of their factories and railroad tracks as well as the churches, schools, library and post office which helped to develop an identity that is uniquely Elmwood section of town. The Prospect Casino Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, May 2009 An article in the Hartford Courant from February 25, 1901, “Casino to Close: Clubhouse on Farmington Avenue to be Leased or Sold,” caught my eye recently. The subtitle read “It has not been much patronized of late, Golf and the Country Club at Farmington Avenue proving stronger attractions—Pleasant Building, but Little Used this Winter.” I had known the casino was on the southwest corner of Farmington Avenue and Prospect near where St. John’s Episcopal Church stands today. It struck me as not quite right that a “dry town” would have a casino, but I had never seen much more than a mention of the place in town. The term casino did not always refer to a place for gambling and West Hartford’s casino was far from our present definition of a casino. Originally the term referred to a small Italian villa, summerhouse or pavilion built for pleasure, usually on the grounds of a larger Italian villa. Its meaning changed through the 19th century, but this original meaning seemed a better fit for the “casino” built in West Hartford in 1894. On January 30, 1894, residents of the West End of Hartford and the east end of West Hartford met at Whiting Lane Schoolhouse to organize building “a clubhouse and casino” to act as a social club on Farmington Avenue. It was named: “The Neighborhood Club Company.” A group of 20 men paid subscriptions worth $5,000 on the way to the needed amount of $7,000. The purpose of the meeting was to talk about building the hall to be “suitable for such amusements as are desired.” H.C. Judd, F.G. Whitmore, Anson Brainerd, and John O. Enders were four of the founders. The club chose among a dozen architectural plans. An 1894 Courant article described it: a low pitched roof rises at the front to a height sufficient for two floors and is surmounted by a platform which is a flag staff rises to a height of fifty feet from the ground. From the roof projects a pleasing dormer balcony. The style of architecture is semi-colonial. Inside, the clubhouse had a reception hall, an office, a ladies’ parlor, reading room, billiard room, assembly hall (66 x 44 feet) with a capacity for seating 500 people for dinner. They built a stage in this room as well. On the second floor, there was an office for the secretary, and a lounging and smoking room. In the basement they built two bowling alleys, a kitchen, dressing rooms, and baths. The building was heated by hot water, and lit, “for the present,” by gas. A wide veranda surrounded the clubhouse on two sides. In the backyard, they planned to build three tennis courts. By time the building was finished, its costs had more than tripled to $23,000. Of the 140 stockholders, about 60 percent of the members lived in West Hartford along Farmington Avenue and Prospect. The other 40 percent lived in the city. According to the rules of the club, “it is intended that the tone of the club life shall be at all times elevating and that nothing in the nature of gaming or carousal shall ever be allowed.” They planned for “ladies and young people” to be part of the club. Clearly built before the term casino evolved, the rules were clear: betting and gambling were prohibited by the by-laws as was selling or keeping liquor. Members held lectures, listened to musicians, hosted theatrical performances, had fairs, and hosted balls. Members went to the casino to read, play games, and just talk. They allowed the Farmington Avenue Christian Association to hold services there until they found a permanent home. The opening party for the club in February 1895 was a real gala! The members decorated the building in “Oriental Luxuriance” and “well-known society people (who) danced the hours away.” A Courant reporter wrote: Society was out in full force and the company was brilliant in the costumes of the ladies, handsome gowns, beautiful bouquets and other accessories of charming toilets. There was a large number of well known people present, and while the chief attraction was the dancing in the ballroom there was a good deal of social chat in the spacious parlors and in the brilliant rooms. Over time the members changed their club’s name from the Neighborhood to the Casino Club. The building was used often for theatrical performances, dances and receptions. When it was warm, the managers enclosed the verandah in cloth in the evening. Women and children came to the club frequently and it kept its reputation as a family club. However, in 1896, the Hartford Golf Club opened. In the late 1890s, the Farmington Golf Club on Outlook Avenue opened. The Fern Street Golf Club was also a going concern at the same time. According to the Courant, interest in the Casino Club fell off when the golf clubs opened. In February 1901, the members decided to close the Casino and they sold the building at a loss for $15,000 to Dr. Naylor. He planned to convert the casino into a home, but never moved in. He leased the building for various functions including entertainment, and Miss B.A. Hollister’s ladies’ gymnastic class. On December 18, 1902 a spectacular fire burned the casino to the ground. The fire began in the rear of the building at about 9:30 at night. Neighbors made the call to the Hartford Fire Department and several companies arrived, but they were not allowed to start fighting the fire until Chief Eaton, who was two and a third miles away, arrived and gave special orders to fight the fire across the city line. The fire companies took more than two hours to put the fire out. Hartford residents complained about having to pay their tax money for fire protection for West Hartford. In fact, many people moved to West Hartford because the tax rate was lower. However, Hartford seemed to supply both police and fire protection to the growing suburb of just over 3,000 residents. There had been talk of a new West Hartford fire district, but the West Hartford selectmen did not vote to fund one until 1909 and the fire company was finally completed in 1915, not far from the site of the fire. As this new upper middle class moved to West Hartford, they organized, developed, and built new ways to spend their leisure time. The Prospect Casino had a short life, but it was an important symbol of the change in West Hartford from farm town to suburb. Those who worked in Hartford’s white-collar jobs organized and joined private clubs for their recreation. These clubs, as well as their new residences in the suburbs, helped define this new middle class. Charter Oak School Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, May 2013 In March 2013, West Hartford’s Board of Education voted to build the first new elementary school since Norfeldt School was built in 1964. A new Charter Oak School, with a price tag of $40 million (with the town paying about $8 million), will open in 2016. The present school houses 270 students and the new school will have room for 560 students from the neighborhood and magnet students from all over town. Charter Oak’s scope and size has changed many times in its history. This investment in a state of the art building will help to do what Board of Education Chair Madeleine McKernan dreamed of over 40 years ago: to provide an equal opportunity for all students no matter where they live in West Hartford. In 1884, the Common School district of West Hartford built the original elementary school in the neighborhood. The one room schoolhouse on the south side of Flatbush Avenue (near the present day Home Depot) at first housed all eight grades, but as the population grew, three more rooms were added, and only K-4 students could fit in Charter Oak. Older students went to Smith School, or the Elmwood School on New Britain Avenue. This little four room Charter Oak area school had a capacity of 100 students. The current Charter Oak School was built in 1930 to accommodate kindergarten to grade 6. The architect, Russell Barker planned for a 15-room building for 560 students with a price tag of $290,000. Superintendent Lloyd Bugbee planned this school as one of the first “modern” schools in the “American perpendicular” style with silver and black colors on the front of the building. One innovation in the building was the inlaid linoleum floor in the kindergarten room with inlaid children’s stories. Architects planned a library in the middle of the school. Miss Bernice Patterson took on the role of teaching principal of the 4-room schoolhouse in 1924. In 1930, when the new school opened, she became the first principal. She served as principal for 22 years when Miss Harriet Foley replaced her. A 2 ½ inch piece of the trunk section of the famous Charter Oak tree was displayed in the main corridor. Walter Korder, a local artist, received New Deal money in the 1930s to paint several fairy tale paintings that still hang in the building. In 1941, the town took the playground behind the school to make fields. The school then acquired play space in the front of the school on Oakwood Avenue. In 1954, the School Board, built a cafeteria in the remodeled basement, after parents advocated for it so children would not need to walk home for lunch. Charter Oak students ate a hot lunch just like those who attended the new schools like Webster Hill (1949), Bugbee (1952), Duffy (1954), and Whiting Lane (1954). In 1957, Building and Grounds added a fence around the entire play area. In 1958 a gym was added, again to keep up with the new schools being built. In 1963, enrollment declined as eminent domain forced families out of homes along the I-84 corridor. Charter Oak lost 60 students in that one year. In September 1972, school administrators hoped to build a new large elementary school for 1,000 students for $4 million to replace Smith and Charter Oak. In 1972, the Hartford Courant reported that the Board of Education wanted “to replace the aging Smith, Charter Oak and Elmwood Schools.” The Board scaled down its plans to a 700 student school to replace just Smith and Charter Oak. But a lack of parental support led the Board to drop the proposal. According to Board Chair Madeline McKernan, the main impetus for the new school was to provide an equal education to students in all areas of town. The Board felt that Charter Oak and Smith’s buildings did not provide an equal education for students in the poorest areas of town. Instead, in November, the Board decided to renovate the existing Charter Oak and expand it so that Smith School could be closed. Parents at Smith promptly organized a group called Save our Schools (SOS) to make sure that Smith did not get shut down. The Board of Education backed off and allowed both schools to remain open and in 1974 voted for funds to rehab each school. In 1975, the Board of Education decided to close the Elmwood School due to declining enrollment. In the early 1980s, Smith closed as well. Since the early 1990s, West Hartford’s Board of Education has been under pressure to racially integrate its elementary schools. The 1968 Racial Balance Act requires towns to integrate within their district by making sure that no school has a racial balance that is 25% above or below the town’s percentage for students of color. The 1994-5 K-2, 3-5 plan attempted to ameliorate this racial imbalance, but public outcry led to the Board of Education rescinding the program which led to three magnet elementary schools instead, hoping for voluntary integration. Charter Oak became one of those magnets. In March 2013, a 20-member committee decided to build a new Charter Oak School rather than revamp the old. New diversity school legislation, designed by the West Hartford legislative delegation and passed in 2012, allows for the town to receive up to 80 percent construction cost for reimbursement if the school is being built with a plan to reach racial balance goals. Regular construction reimbursement for West Hartford is 40%. The story of Charter Oak School, a school named after a rebellious Connecticut event to protect democracy in the 1600s, represents much about our town. It was the third elementary school, after Beach Park and Morley, to be built in town. Its original architectural plan broke new ground and its changing demographics point to the change in West Hartford’s population in the past 40 years. Though the housing stock in its neighborhood has changed little, the skin color and languages of those who live in these houses has changed. The parents’ desire for a state of the art school to provide the best environment for their children, on the drawing board for the second time in 40 years, will soon become a reality. West Hartford in 1896 Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, January 2009. Thanks to Dick Kreitner for the atlas. This fall a friend passed along a real treasure to me in my role as the Town Historian: a 112-year-old atlas of Hartford and West Hartford. The atlas provides unique information. It opens up a world to me that newspaper articles and even photographs cannot engender. The Atlas of the City of Hartford Connecticut, including also the Town of West Hartford tells me much about the economic world of West Hartford over a century ago. It defines the town of West Hartford as a town that supported agriculture and industry, as it became a suburb of Hartford, on which it depended for its economic well-being. In 1896, West Hartford had about 2,500 residents and was just starting to move from farm town to suburb. L.J. Richards &amp; Co. of Springfield, Massachusetts published the atlas based on records from Hartford and West Hartford municipal engineers and some of the publisher’s own engineers. There are 30 Plates in the book, 26 from Hartford, and four from West Hartford. You can browse through this atlas in the Local History Room in West Hartford’s Noah Webster Public Library, or their historical maps online page. Plate 27 is a map of the entire town, showing every dwelling in town. The mapmakers delineated whether buildings were brick, wood, brick and wood, stone, iron, whether it was a barn stable or shed, or a greenhouse. The atlas includes the owners’ names for each dwelling and piece of land. The map marks sewers under Park Street from Prospect past South Main, and on Fern, Quaker Lane, and the south end of Steele Road, a sure sign of the infrastructure built for residential neighborhoods. The street railway that traversed Farmington Avenue spanned the town from east to west. The Hartford and West Hartford Horse Railroad Company, incorporated in 1863 sent the line out to West Hartford in 1889. By the 1890s, West Hartford’s farmers specialized in dairy. The two creameries in town, Highland Creamery on the southwest corner of Albany Avenue and Mountain Road and the Elmwood Creamery owned by C.M. Beach, now part of Beachland Park, were important parts of this agricultural base. According to William H. Hall in his West Hartford (1930), the creamery was supplied by the farms that surrounded each dairy. On Plate 27, the publishers named two farms in town: Boswell Farm on the westside of South Main where Rockledge is today, and Maplewood owned by F.A. Thomson across the street. These farms were just to the north of the Vine Hill Farm and Grist Mill which included land on three corners of New Britain Avenue and South Main Street. Gristmills in town at the time are a reflection of the continued agricultural base. There were the Trout Brook Grist Mill on North Main where Trout Brook crosses near American School for the Deaf, and the grist mill next to the Elmwood Creamery in today’s Beachland Park. Daniels Mill Company owned a gristmill on the corner of Simsbury Road and Bloomfield Avenue. Daniels Mill Co. was established in 1835, according to the directory at the back of the atlas. Here, the publishers listed “well-known citizens, representing the business, professional and educational interest of the city, through whose hearty support alone the completion of this volume has been made possible.” Daniels Mill sold wholesale and retail flour, feed, grain, hay and straw. “Grain by the carload” was their specialty. Their headquarters at 40 Elm Street in Hartford represented the close connection between the economies of Hartford and West Hartford. Farmers specialized in greenhouse grown plants as well. There were greenhouses on Whiting Lane owned by Alfred Whiting. Next to the Hartford Brick Company on New Park Avenue stood the greenhouses of Charles K. Swenson, one of the many Swedish immigrants who worked with plants. W.E. Wallace sold nursery goods on the corner of Farmington Avenue and Quaker Lane from his greenhouse. According to Hall’s book, Wales Andrews had four greenhouses on the corner of New Britain Avenue and Grove Street where he specialized in growing cucumbers. Wallace Thomson founded the W.W. Thomson Company at 146 South Main Street in 1899. Originally they grew vegetables and produce that they sold to farmer’s markets in the region. His son, W. Pomeroy Thomson, produced over 30 new varieties of carnations between 1958 and 1988 in West Hartford, Florida, and Bogota, Colombia. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. Many successful businessmen who worked in Hartford, lived in West Hartford and supported the making of the Atlas are listed in the directory in the back of the book. Charles M. Beach of the Beach Dye Works, J.J. Enders of State Savings Bank, J. L English, secretary of Aetna Life who lived on Fern Street, and Bernard Caya, contractor lived on Prospect Avenue. F.C. Rockwell, who was the head of the Bonsilate Box Co. lived on Prospect Avenue. He subdivided the land along the Boulevard as he looked forward to one of the first suburban developments in town. E.H. Arnold &amp; Sons used the pond from the dammed up Trout Brook at Farmington Avenue to harvest ice. His Trout Brook Ice and Feed Company needed five buildings to take care of its business. Headquarters for Arnold’s building were on Asylum Avenue downtown. His company was both wholesale and retail selling ice and grain. By 1896, West Hartford also had its share of industry. The clay soil led to brick making as a lucrative business. There were three brick companies in town. On New Park Avenue, with railroad spurs right into their yards were the Hartford Brick Company and across the tracks, the Charter Oak Brick Company. On the corner of Prospect and Caya Avenue was the Dennis &amp; Co. Brick Manufacturers. Brickmakers used the clay soil in the southeast section of town to build several lucrative businesses. The Phoenix Brick Company, Park Brick Company, and the brickyards of Michael Kane lined the railroad line in the industrial section of town. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. Along the railroad tracks in the southeast section of town industry grew. The Whitlock Coil and Pipe Company was across the tracks from the Goodwin Brothers Pottery. Whitlock Coil and Pipe opened its doors in 1892 and manufactured coiled pipe used for use with steam boilers. The Goodwin Brothers began the pottery business to take advantage of the clay, just as the brickmakers did. They sold their jugs and jars across the continent. For entertainment, on the corner of Prospect and Farmington where St. John’s Episcopal Church stands today, was the Prospect Casino. On Prospect and New Park, race enthusiasts could go to the Charter Oak Driving Park. There was a bandstand, a grandstand, and a half-mile track. Both of these establishments depended on Hartford residents for their success. The center was beginning to be a retail center. Where the present day library sits was the Carriage Repository and Hardware Store. Buckland’s Store and Post Office stood at the corner of Main and Farmington. But, these are the only two retail establishments in the center. The real growth came in the 1930s. Economically, West Hartford continued to depend on Hartford. Farmers sold their produce to Hartford residents, the railroad that passed through the southeast corner of town connected goods to the city center, and Hartford businessmen brought value as they began to settle in the residential suburb. L.J. Richards’ Atlas confirms that West Hartford’s prosperity depended on Hartford’s economy. Back then, residents and businesses knew that their prosperity depended on the city. Today, many West Hartford residents continue to understand how West Hartford’s economy is tied to that of Hartford and the region that surrounds it. A Day in This Town’s History: August 10, 1899 Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, July 2009 An August 10, 1899 news brief from the Hartford Courant opens a window into West Hartford at the turn of the 20th century. This seven-paragraph article has 272 words and provides a sense of the fabric of a town changing from a farm town into a suburb. Item one: Mrs. F.H. Stadtmueller as a ’Ceres&quot; presided at the meeting of the Grange Tuesday evening. The hall was prettily decorated with stalks of corn and golden rod. Papers upon grains were read by Mrs. S.P. Griswold, D.G. Francis, Dr. Ganunack, Mrs. P.R. Day and Mrs. Paullson. It has been decided to postpone the matter of an excursion for the present. Imagine Mrs. Stadtmueller dressed like the Roman goddess of agriculture, wearing a garland of ears of corn. Ceres was an elected position in the Grange, which started as a secret organization in town in 1887 with 32 charter members. The purpose of the Grange was to improve social connections and fight the economic backwardness of farmers. The interests of West Hartford Grange 58 included education, improvement in public highways, rural mail delivery and town affairs. Yearly, they prepared exhibits for the annual state fairs at Charter Oak Park. According to Hall’s History of West Hartford, even in 1930, the Grange continued “its organization and its interest in the town.” Stadtmueller presided over the meeting, introducing the five speakers, three of whom were women. In 1900, as this town’s population topped 3,000, some suburban developments like Buena Vista and West Hartford Heights were beginning as the trolley made transportation to Hartford easier. While “grains” were being celebrated, however, the production of grain acreage in New England dwindled. Between 1880 and 1930, almost 19 million acres in New England were taken out of farming, and the number of farms declined by 31 percent. The surviving farms in town specialized in dairy and market gardens providing plantings for suburban homes. Mrs. Stadtmueller was the wife of Frank E. Stadtmueller, who from 1885 to 1907 managed the Beach’s Vine Hill Farm, which occupied acreage from New Britain Avenue to South Main Street to South Quaker Lane. This dairy farm was a model for the state in producing “baby’s milk.” While Vine Hill continued to prosper for another two decades, farmland was becoming more valuable for residential housing than for farming. Perhaps the Grange was glorifying an agricultural life that they saw slipping away. Item two: The Rev. John Freeborg held a meeting for the Swedish people at the Baptist Church. A considerable number of Swedes are employed in town and they are interested to hear preaching in their own language and attend the meetings as well. By 1900, Swedes were one of the largest immigrant groups in town. Between 1851 and 1930 as much as 25 percent of the Swedish population emigrated to the United States. A second wave of immigration in the 1880s and 1890s found young Swedes settling in Connecticut near urban areas. In 1970, this town had the highest percentage of people of Swedish background in the state. Swedes settled in the Park Road area, building two- and three-family houses and starting businesses. At one time, the building owned by Bazilians was a Swedish grocery story. Still remaining on Park Road are Hall’s Market, where you can still buy Swedish sausage called korv, and A.C. Petersen’s. According to Butterworth, Grant and Woodworth in Celebrate! West Hartford (2003), 20 Swedish immigrants from West Hartford, New Britain and Hartford formed a Methodist church in 1895. They built their first church on the corner of Lockwood Terrace and the Boulevard in 1921. Today that church is the Boulevard Baptist Church. The Swedish Methodist Church finally moved to Berkshire Road and New Britain Avenue and today is known as the West Hartford United Methodist Church. The ability of a Swede who was probably a Methodist to speak at a Baptist Church speaks to the interdenominational sharing in our town. The town’s many denominations have shared pulpits in times of disaster and overcrowding. Item three: Millie Fulton, youngest daughter of C.W. Fulton, received a bad cut just below the knee from a piece of glass while playing about the mill pond the other day. Dr. Alcott, who was called, was obliged to sew up the wound. The mill pond on Trout Brook was on the north side of Farmington Avenue. This pond was used in the winters to harvest ice, but in the summer must have been a great place, except for the glass, to go for a swim. Dr. Ralph W.E. Alcott was one of the doctors in town at the turn of the century. In the birth records, his name appears as attending to the delivery of babies in people’s homes before the advent of having babies in hospitals. He was involved in promoting the development of a sewer system here at the turn of the century as an important development to protect against the spread of disease. Item four: Misses Helen and Elizabeth Hubbard are at Branford for a week. Mrs. E.M. Peck is visiting relatives in West Haven. A daughter was born recently to Mr. and Mrs. John Hoye. These three tidbits of information reflect on the small town that this was in 1899. Vacations and visits were noted weekly. A trip to Branford was not so difficult for residents because of the train lines that ran to the shore. By the 1880s, with the rise of factories, taking a week-long vacation became popular. Many residents owned or rented cottages on the Connecticut shore. Item five: A resident of Charter Oak was before Justice A.C. Sternberg last night charged with stealing corn from the garden of Mrs. E.A. Talcott near East Street, Elmwood. The accused was found in the corn after dark by Herbert Talcott, but claimed that he was there for other purposes and was an honest man. Bags found on the ground he disclaimed owning. The accused was supported in his testimony by Mrs. Teresa Buck of Charter Oak. As the theft was not proved, the case was nulled. There has been considerable complaint of the theft of garden truck from the region bordering on Charter Oak. In the alleged burglary in the 1899 paper, a frustrated farmer, Mrs. E.A. Talcott, tried to find who was stealing her corn. A character witness, vouching for the innocence of the accused, helped to get the case nulled. There was no lack of tension in turn of the century West Hartford. Judge Adolph C. Sternberg served in the state legislature from 1895-96. He was a German immigrant and the son of a highly educated man who moved here in 1854. He grew up with seven brothers and one sister on the southern end of Mountain Road where it meets Sedgwick Road. Sternberg, as well as being a judge, helped move this town from the town meeting to the town council manager system of government. In 1916, there was so much controversy over the valuation of agricultural and residential land between farmers and suburbanites that residents rejected the assessment list and the town could collect no taxes for that year, having to borrow to pay its expenses. This controversy moved the town to adopt a new town charter in 1919 that made it the first town in the state to adopt this progressive form of government. This news from the summer of 1899 describes a farm town with community organizations, immigrants, people wealthy enough to go on week-long vacations and law breaking. The Hartford Courant kept people apprised of not only the political and organizational news, but also of the social fabric of the town that helped to stitch us into a community. Abraham Janes, Blacksmith Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, February 2012 My article this month started by researching what was happening in Town 100 years ago. That search took me to the Historical Hartford Courant, just a click away through the West Hartford Public Library online service. There, I found that a January 14, 1912 fire raged for five hours at Abraham Janes’ Blacksmith and Carriage Shop, 921 Farmington Avenue. The fire displaced two families, and destroyed over $12,000 worth of property. Janes would later rebuild his carriage and blacksmith shop and run it well into the 1920s. That sounded like a story to me: perseverance and grit with community support. So, I’d write about the fire and how the Janes business was rebuilt. Initially, I found two articles on the fire and thought I was set. At the time of the fire, Mr. Janes, his wife, their six children and an apprentice lived over the repository of his blacksmith shop. Walter Payne, an employee of the Hartford Water Board and his wife and three children lived over the blacksmith shop. The first floor of the building was a paint shop, blacksmith shop, the repository and an office. The basement had two forges, wood working machinery and storage booths. When the fire broke out, Mr. Janes and two others rescued the eight sleeping children just before they were consumed by fire. West Hartford’s volunteer Fountain Hose Company rushed to put out the fire. The nearby Congregational Church’s bell called the volunteer firemen who rushed to the scene. The row of houses on Nichols Court that ran parallel to Raymond Road, (then School Street), did not catch fire because the night was so still. Reports claimed the temperature was 16 below zero. Janes had insured the property for $11,000. The loss was close to $12,000. The Payne family was only able to save a small trunk of clothing and a few bedclothes. Several wagons and sleighs and three cars were saved, but another car burned. A month later, the insurance company had still not paid Janes. This stopped Janes’ attempts to build a temporary shed to continue jobbing and horseshoeing. Janes, according to the Courant, had not been idle, attending to his customers at their homes or elsewhere as soon as he got the materials needed to shoe. His plans were to rebuild a one-story shop on the foundation of the burned building. Still, he took a loss and had to borrow money to keep his son in college. Part of the story about fires is not just about how the victims reacted, but how the community kicked in. According to the Courant, the response was “generous.” The women of the First Church met in the parlor the next Monday morning to work on articles of clothing for the Janes children. The pastor of the Paynes South Park Methodist Church asked for help for their 6, 4, and 2 year old children. Congregants donated $75 to the Paynes. But who was this man, Janes? Like most life stories, his was complicated. There were articles about him running afoul of the law – passing a standing trolley, trying to collect money from customers who stiffed him, and in 1931, having his house on Quaker Lane go into foreclosure. A continued search led me to more features on Janes. As cars became the mode of transportation, and as the role of a blacksmith changed from shoeing horses to specialty work, the Courant memorialized him in one article “Childhood Trade Brings Him Fame: Abraham Janes of West Hartford Follows Art of Smithy His Father Taught Him As A Boy in Newfoundland,” (1927) and a year later, “Abraham Janes, Artist in Wrought Iron Work: Sparks Fly From the Anvil Where, Under an Expert’s Hands, Modern Iron Becomes Latches, Grills, and Lanterns in the Style of Other Days” (1928). In these articles I found out that Abraham Janes was born in 1872 in Brigus, Newfoundland, and grew up there where he apprenticed to his blacksmith father for 10 years. At age 17 Janes went to the Arctic on Peary’s first polar expedition. He set up a forge on Turnavik Island, mending the dog sleds and iron needed for exploration over the northern ice and for the ship. In 1898, at age 26, he emigrated to Hartford and opened his shop on Farmington Avenue. For the 27 years of his traditional blacksmith shop, he claimed, he made 53 vehicles per year and shoed hundreds of horses. One day he shod a pair of horses in 34 minutes without assistance. On another day, in 18 hours, he shod 53 horses. When there was a strike and riot in Ansonia in 1901, the cavalry was called out to stop the strike. Janes and an assistant went to the stables and, working under pressure , shod 43 horses between 2am and 7am Janes got involved in the community as well. After the shop burned, he moved to Quaker Lane between Farmington and Park. In 1912, he joined on with Theodore Roosevelt’s Bull Moose Party, attending a local convention. In 1913 he was elected gatekeeper of the Grange. He served as a member of the Fountain Hose Company No. 1 apparatus committee, being part of rebuilding the combination truck to equip it for fire fighting. He was the head of the committee to build a new firehouse shed a few years after the fire burned his place of work. And, the Courant reported, that Janes’ work changed with the times. By the late 1920s, Janes, at age 56, still worked at the shop, but made thumb latches, butterfly hinges, grills, and balcony railings for bars and clubs as far away as New York and New Jersey. Janes fashioned all the hand-wrought iron at the Hartford Theological Seminary (now the University of Connecticut Law School), the window grills on the Fire Department in Hartford, the balconies and stair rail at the Fuller Brush building, the Spanish Balconies at the Hartford Club dining rooms, and iron work on West Hartford homes on Sycamore, Albany Avenue, and Whiting Lane. As I searched for Janes’ obituary, to round out his story, it was not in the Courant. One of his 10 siblings died in 1940 and Abraham Janes was listed as living in Memphis, Tennessee. His wife, Lillian Janes died in 1957 at age 84, while living on Lancaster Road and her obituary claimed she died a widow. She left four sons and three daughters, three of whom lived in West Hartford. Janes’ story was more of a puzzle than I thought. Where he was between 1931 and 1957 is not clear. In a Google search I found a family genealogy website produced by one of his 37 grandchildren. Several comments under his photograph helped to put flesh on his bones. One grandchild said: Grandpa Janes (Abraham) was a good looking man, my Dad once said he didn’t smoke, drink or swear and had only one weakness: women. My Dad was attending Norwich University when the separation occurred between our grandparents. He left school and went home to help support the family. I’m left to speculate that Abraham left Lillian sometime during the Depression, perhaps as the house went into foreclosure. Perhaps his trips to New York City to sell his specialized wares opened up new horizons. Losing his house to foreclosure might have been too much for his pride to stay in West Hartford. Or maybe, like his grandson suggested, there was another woman that drew him away from his adopted town. I think there are some readers who may remember his shop on Farmington Avenue or knew his family. Can you help me fill in the story? Research that started with a fire 100 years ago led to a master craftsman who changed with the times but whose full story is still not complete. Henry Selden: A Man Who Changed with the Times Originally appeared in Hartford Life, December 2001. Thank you to Bob Strickland, a long time resident of Selden Hill, who wants to keep the memory of the Seldens alive, and lent me several articles. The life of West Hartford resident Henry Hezekiah Selden (1854-1932), symbolizes the sweeping changes in the United States as the economy and technology modernized our nation. Historians have described how the Second Industrial Revolution in the post Civil War period revolutionized the lives of average Americans. How did a man like Selden adapt to these changes while he retained his life as a traditional dairy farmer? In 1776, the Selden family moved to Great Hill in what was then Farmington. When Henry Selden was five, in 1859, about 330 acres known as Selden Hill and now known as Buena Vista, West Hartford annexed this area in response to a petition by Henry’s uncle, Hezekiah Selden. This section of land is bounded by the reservoir on the north, Farmington on the west, West Farms Mall on the south, and Cornerstone Pool and the skating rink on the east. By the mid-1800s, most New England farms had become dairy farms. With the new Erie Canal and railroad transportation, the opening of fertile land in Ohio, and the move westward, it was no longer profitable to grow wheat here. In the 1850s, some farmers in West Hartford grazed sheep, but the Selden’s chose to keep cows. Henry attended the West School, a one-room schoolhouse that still stands on Mountain Road and now houses the West Hartford Art League. In the early 1870s, he spent a semester or two at Williston Academy in central Massachusetts to complete his education. He returned to the farm at Selden Hill to work for his father. As a dairy farmer, Henry cut and delivered hay in the summer, cut ice on Wood Pond in the winter, mended fences, and cared for livestock. The farm had 25 to 30 head of cattle, four horses and 150 acres of farmland. Their property had eight outbuildings and a 12-room farmhouse. A farmer who held 50 acres of land could live a good life. Henry’s interest in new inventions started early. In the mid-1860s, when Henry was still a child, he watched men build the reservoir across Farmington Avenue from his parents’ dairy farm. Some of the workmen stayed at the Selden Farm while on the project. One of these workman’s jobs was to feed the horses and young Henry was fascinated by the small Seth Thomas alarm clock, which awakened him every morning. According to his granddaughter Dorothy Selden, the young worker was willing to trade the clock to Henry for some useless trinkets. Henry’s fascination with things mechanical must have been piqued by the new pump organ at the First Congregational Church in the center of town. This church, the third building, was on the northwest corner of Farmington and Main and stood until 1957. Henry got a job in the church as the first boy to pump the new organ. Henry’s interest in things technological continued into early adulthood. In 1876, when he was 22, he and his mother, father, aunt and uncle made the journey, by rail to Philadelphia, to celebrate the centennial of the United States. On August 21, the group of five set off for this city on the train from Hartford to New Haven. They boarded a boat in New Haven for New York City where they again boarded the train to Germantown Junction, Pennsylvania where they checked in at a hotel opposite the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. They stayed in Philadelphia for five days and Henry kept a diary of his visit. The exhibits from China, the Sandwich Islands, Belgium, and England intrigued him. But he was most interested in Machinery Hall, the Saw Mill, the railroad exhibit and a printing shop. When his parents and aunt and uncle returned to the hotel, Henry stayed and rode the cars around the Centennial Exhibition. The next day they toured again, and Henry returned to Machinery Hall. He was so intrigued by the building, that in later years he named one of the buildings on his farm Machinery Hall. After a five-day visit, the Seldens took the 7:10 train out of Philadelphia, arrived in New York City at 10:30, hired a carriage, drove through the botanical gardens there, and arrived in Hartford by train by 9:30 p.m. The technology in Philadelphia intrigued the young farmer from West Hartford. Henry, according to his granddaughter, preferred to work with machines rather than the soil. His interest in machines led him to build a mill on his property where he cut lumber for himself and his neighbors. He built a lathe powered by horses on a treadmill and he had his own repair shop and blacksmith shop. Henry married Sarah Whiting in 1888 when he was an established bachelor at the age of 34. They went on to have eight children, and Henry taught them how to work on the farm. At the age of five, they started to do jobs on what was a prosperous farm. Most of Henry’s income came from milk, butter, and hay. There were times when he allowed his six and seven year olds to take his hay by themselves with their wagon to Hartford. His daughter, Rilla Selden (b. 1898) remembers wrapping pounds of butter in parchment and sitting high on the horse-drawn wagon with her father as he traveled his delivery route and getting down at each house to deliver the fresh butter at 25 cents per pound. Henry was always looking for something new. Between 1898 and 1902, he and his sister-in-law opened the Selden Ice Cream Parlor in West Hartford Center at the present location of the Treva Restaurant. It was at the end of the trolley line that made it from Hartford to the center by 1889. According to Selden’s granddaughter Dorothy, the ice cream parlor was the first to use fresh fruit in their ice cream. The store closed when a nearby drug store began to serve ice cream Henry Selden ran his ice cream parlor in West Hartford Center between 1898 and 1902 where LaSalle Road intersects with Farmington Avenue. Source: Selden Family. Henry Selden bought his first car in 1918 when he was 64. He enjoyed riding in it, but decided not to drive it because he was so hard of hearing by that time that he couldn’t tell whether the motor was running. Once, when he did decide to drive it on the farm, he was heard yelling “Whoa! Whoa!” to stop it. In 1926, 50 years after his trip to Philadelphia to celebrate the U.S. Centennial, Henry and two of his sons, Irving and Roland, took their Model T to Philadelphia for the U.S. Sesquicentennial. The fact that Henry enjoyed this celebration as much as he did as a young man is a testament to his willingness to use and learn about modern technology. He learned how to integrate it into the workings of his already established farm. Elmwood’s Frank Stadtmueller Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, May 2006 Frank Stadtmueller came to public prominence as West Hartford was changing from a rural town to a suburb. He was a progressive farmer who advocated a role for farming in 20th century Connecticut and West Hartford. As a Democrat in an overwhelmingly Republican town, Stadtmueller held positions as Justice of the Peace, a member of the school committee, head of the West Hartford Democratic Caucus, Town Selectman, Vestryman at St. John’s Episcopal Church, West Hartford’s Building Inspector, and West Hartford’s Health Officer. In the state, he served as the President of the Sheepbreeder’s Association, President of the Connecticut Dairymen’s Association, and the State Agricultural Commissioner. Stadtmueller always listed his place of residence as Elmwood. Stadtmueller was born in 1861 on the Vine Hill Farm owned by Charles Mason Beach. His father Louis Stadtmueller was a German immigrant who worked for the Beaches. At age 6, the family moved to New Haven and Stadtmueller grew up there and graduated from Yale. He returned to Vine Hill in 1885 and, at age 24, took over the management of the farm for the next 30 years. He worked hand in hand with Beach’s son, Charles Edward who was one year younger than Stadtmueller. Stadtmueller championed progressive farming. He and Charles Beach were the “inventors” of “baby’s milk” or what was known as “sanitary milk” in Connecticut. To produce baby’s milk, they kept the cows clean and the milkers free from disease. Each day, they tested the milk in the lab. Before the 1890s, infants only drank mother’s milk. Beach and Stadtmueller marketed cow’s milk to children. Stadtmueller is most well known for being the originator of the certified milk business in Connecticut, between 1890 and 1920. His work force at Vine Hill farm is dressed in whites with caps carrying covered buckets of milk. Their attempt to improve the sanitation milking cows led to advertising this milk for babies as “Clinical Nursery Milk.” Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. Stadtmueller was a businessman and an advocate as well as a farmer. He believed that milk had to be marketed and he believed the state had a role to play in doing this by inspecting milk, certifying its cleanliness, and providing price supports. In 1907, at a meeting of the Connecticut Dairymen’s Association, Stadtmueller gave a talk on problems with the low market price of milk. However, having regulations and enforcement were two different things. At the state dairymen’s convention in 1913, the president of the group, Warren Davis, said that municipal milk inspection was “a joke.” He argued that the legislature would not appropriate enough money for inspection and that the inspection should be done by the State Health Department, rather than local health officers. Stadtmueller believed that when each municipality inspected milk, the standards varied a great deal. The producer who lived closest to the point of distribution was inspected much more than the one further away and he believed that a state standard would help the situation. In 1917, as the State Dairy and Food Commissioner, he arrested the First Selectman of Southbury and four others for selling “watered milk.” These men felt the pressure of the cost of producing milk. Stadtmueller could use these men both as an example of the need for standards and the hard time that milk producers had producing a profit of any kind. In 1914, in a speech before a meeting of the Men’s Union of the First Congregational Church, Stadtmueller decried the plight of the farmer in Connecticut, claiming that many of their problems were based on poor distribution of goods and the lack of cooperation between farmers. He also believed that the price of milk had to go up two cents per quart or even more men would give up dairy farming. In that same year, as President of the Hartford County Rural Improvement Association, Stadtmueller encouraged those in attendance to value agriculture. Hartford County in 1909 produced $6 million worth of agricultural goods. He knew of large areas of “wasteland” that had gone to brush that could double Hartford County’s agricultural production. He urged “the children to stay on the farm instead of flocking to the city.” Cooperation among producers, he said, would lead to success. Stadtmueller’s idea of an organization came to fruition in 1915 when his Hartford Country Rural Improvement Association (of which he was President) and the Board of Trade came together to discuss how they could help each other to save agriculture for the county. The amount of farmland decreased every decade, farmers moved west, and the many no longer thought of New England as an agricultural region. Stadtmueller seemed at his best when he used his position in various agencies to bring people together. Stadtmueller also helped found and lead the West Hartford Business Men’s Association. In November 1910, they held a meeting on the subject of a public utilities commission. Stadtmueller’s Association called in two speakers from Hartford, Normand Allen and Ralph O. Wells, who explained the reasons that a commission was needed to control the “great public service corporations.” Allen, the owner of the Sage Allen Department Store explained that there “was no opposition to the great corporations.” He believed that there needed to be a way to secure the safety of employees on railways, to be sure that electric and gas meters measured use fairly, and that rates for electric and gas be controlled because they were unfair. Allen proposed a public utilities commission of three to five men being paid $7,500 a piece to regulate the industry. The other speaker, Ralph O. Wells was concerned with the “baleful influence of the lobby in Connecticut legislation.” He believed that the Legislature was not controlled by reason but by corporations trading votes and “log rolling” to get what they needed. He believed that the electric and gas corporations had much too much power. Stadtmueller believed that government regulation and associational cooperation could improve life for farmers and consumers. During the 1930s, with Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, the federal government, for the first time introduced price supports for agricultural products and established a “cost yardstick” for the cost of electrical power. In the 1910s, Elmwood’s Frank Stadtmueller (1861-1918) already brought these issues to the public’s eyes. Where many historians argue that the push for more government intervention in the economy came from the federal level, in fact the ideas were brewing on the local level right here in West Hartford a quarter of a century earlier, during the Progressive Era. The Site that Became Blue Back Square Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, December 2007 Noah Webster’s statue, complete with a new finger, is repositioned in the town’s center and the three square blocks that are Blue Back Square have come to life in a mix of retail, restaurants, office space and housing. It is already difficult to remember what used to be in these lots. A look back 100 years gives a window into how much and how often land use changes. Blue Back Square occupies twenty acres with 200,000 square feet of retail space, 200,000 square feet of office space, two parking garages with about 1,000 spaces, apartments, condominiums, a renovated public library, and a passive public park on the southeast corner of Raymond and Memorial Drives. Just two years ago, it included the Grody car dealership, which was a toxic site, three 3-family houses, the Hayes-Velhage American Legion post, a town parking lot, the Board of Education building, and green space. Hayes-Velage American Legion Hall sat at the corner of Raymond Road and Memorial Drive. It was one of the casualties of Blue Back Square when it was taken down in 2005 for the new development. Both Hayes and Velhage died in World War I. Grody Chevrolet car dealership appears behind on Raymond Road. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. When the developers and the Town of West Hartford first put together their development plans, Blue Back’s 20 acres were taxed at a value of $3.5 million. Completed, the developers believed the market value would reach $110 million. Already by 2006, Blue Back became the single largest taxpayer in town. How else has this site changed in a century? A look at the Atlas of the City of Hartford, Connecticut, including, also, the town of West Hartford, 1896 and 1909 shows the plot of land which is now Blue Back Square. You can go online to the West Hartford Public Library site, click on Local History, then West Hartford Historical Maps. On the edge of Goodman Green, on the land which is now the public library, was the Masonic Hall. The Masonic Hall is now on the west side of Goodman Green. South of the Masonic Hall was W.A. Burr’s Carriage Repository &amp; Hardware Store. What is now Memorial Drive was a road with no name. On the site of the present Hartford Hospital and New York Sports Club building stood the town’s second Center School, built in 1896. Until this school was built, high school students attended the first Center School at 14 North Main Street In 1896, at the site of the present Town Hall, there were four residences: Mrs. Margaret W. Seyms, Mrs. Charles Cain, and J. P. Oviatt all who had houses made of wood. Mrs. Seyms had four out buildings on her property. Asher Rogers owned a very small plot and small house, carved out of the lot of the Oviatt’s. W.A. Burr owned the land on the southside of the block bounded on the south by what is now Burr Street. In 1896, the land was subdivided, with no houses yet built. Not too much changed on this block in the next 13 years even though West Hartford’s population nearly tripled from around 1,800 to about 4,800 by 1909. The buildings and owners showed continuity. On the southeast edge of Goodman Green stood the Masonic Hall and W.A. Burr’s Carriage and Hardware Store remained. The town added another brick building to the schoolyard at the corner of Raymond Road and School Street (now Memorial Drive). High and elementary school students shared the new school building until 1910 when the high school took over the whole Center School building and the elementary school children went into the new Whitman School built right next door. This building appeared on the 1909 map. This site now includes the parking garage, the condominiums and the Hartford Hospital building. In 1924, the new high school, named after William H. Hall opened on the west side of the block right along South Main Street. The Center School became known as the Rutherford Building and was kept as a town building and in the 1940s and 1950s served as an annex for Hall High. Take a look at the name of the Hartford Hospital building in Blue Back Square – over the main entrance appears the name “Rutherford Building.” W.A. Burr continued to own the south side of the block. The Seyms property had been transferred from Margaret to G. H. Seyms. Three of the outbuildings were subdivided into two separate lots. C.F. Scarborough owned the Cain property. There were three buildings on his property. John Gridley purchased the Asher Rogers house and lot. Along Burr Street, three houses were built and there were owners for six of the 11 subdivided lots. In 1936, the town used federal funds provided through the PWA to build both the Noah Webster Library and the Town Hall. The library, built in 1918 on the corner of North Main and Brace Road, lasted only 18 years. The new Town Hall building replaced the third building of First Congregational Church which stood at the site of the veteran’s memorial. The Town Hall, with its grand gold cupola, served that purpose from 1936 until 1987 when the former Hall High was renovated and the town offices moved there. At the same time, the town sold its education building on Steele Road and the education offices moved into the former Town Hall. As the town tried to consolidate its services, and with the push of the Blue Back Square developers, the education offices moved into the Town Hall in 2006. The old Town Hall serves as Fleming’s Steak House and the Bow Tie Cinemas. Those who have visited Blue Back Square, will recognize the familiar Noah Webster statue and the cupola and front entrance on a new building at the site of the old Town Hall. The four and five story buildings down the hill give the new three-block area a very different feel. The streets are alive with shoppers and workers and a new Rutherford Building replaces one on the same site named over 80 years ago. The change seems drastic when you stand at the corner of Memorial and Isham Roads. Do you think the sense of loss and gain match what people thought 70 years ago when the library and town hall replaced Burr’s Carriage and Hardware Store? Alfred Plant Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, May 2012 On April 20, 1921, businessman and community leader Alfred E. Plant died at age 48. Within three weeks, the Board of Education, of which he had been a part for at least 11 years decided to name the new junior high school after him. When the school board voted to name the new Junior High Building after him, they cited his “faithful service as a member of the board…” and that “his interest in the welfare of the schools was unfailing and the action by the school board will meet with general favor by the residents of the town.” Plant Junior High opened in 1922 as one of the first junior high schools in the state. Alfred E. Plant was born in 1873 in the northwestern part of England. His hometown Macclesfield, was most known for manufacturing silk. At age 23, Plant married Hannah Grimshaw and six years later in 1902, they emigrated from England to Hartford. Plant got a job at Aetna in that year. He joined the Accident and Liability Department when it was formed and at his early death, was one of its oldest members. He served as secretary to two successive vice presidents of the company. Plant was an insurance man on the ground floor of Hartford’s growth as the insurance capital. Plant moved to the United States during the Progressive Era when reformers began to question the power of industrial capitalists. This new Aetna department handled the new business of employers’ liability and workmen’s compensation insurance. As Plant settled into town, he got involved in community activities. By 1909, Plant was elected secretary of the West Hartford Republican Party. Republicans controlled the politics of the town in the Progressive Era. Republicans were the party of Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt and a party that had begun to regulate business to protect consumers. He joined the First Congregational Church in the town’s center and by 1911 was a leader in the Men and Religion Forward Movement, an attempt by men across the country to increase the number of male churchgoers. Plant ran monthly meetings that attracted more than 60 men from around town. The minister of the First Congregational Church Rev. T. M. Hodgdon spoke and the West Hartford Glee Club sang to attract men back to the fold. Plant also served as a master of Wyllys Lodge, No. 99 and was a charter member of the Syria Grotto. Masons founded West Hartford’s Wyllys Lodge in 1866. The Masons were a fraternal organization with their roots in 18th century England. Before the Masonic Temple was built on South Main Street just South of Farmington Avenue, they met in the old high school building on North Main Street near the Old Burial Ground. When Plant died, plans were in the works to build the new Temple that opened in 1923. Plant served his community as an appointed member of the Town School Committee. He quickly became the clerk/secretary and served until his death. In the 1910s when the population grew from 5,000 to 9,000 over the decade, the school population grew just as fast. From 1915 with a school population of 1,350 to 1925 with a school population of 3,250, the school committee was busy. Superintendent William Hall oversaw the building of eight new buildings over this period of time. School committee members sat on committees, which dealt with the nuts and bolts of supplies and the library, as only a few people worked for pay in the central office. In 1911, Plant and his wife bought a lot and built a home on the outskirts of the center on Pleasant Street, off Farmington Avenue halfway between Main Street and Mountain Road. They raised their son and two daughters there. In 1918 during World War I, their son Alfred G. Plant enlisted in the Army. The son continued to live in West Hartford after his father died and had a long career at the Aetna. Plant’s death at age 48 left his widow Hannah and three children just coming to adulthood. His commitment to his community clear, the school committee named the new school after him. Fifty-seven years later, when Plant Junior High closed in 1979, the PTO moved to re-name King Philip Junior High after Alfred Plant, but those efforts did not come to fruition. It took over three years for the town to decide what to do with the school after it closed. But, in October 1982 after a 41-month discussion, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development approved a grant of $6 million for the West Hartford Housing Authority to develop 100 low-income units for the poor. The West Hartford Housing Authority formed as a non-profit in 1942 when the town, funded by the federal government, built 300 housing units for defense workers during World War II. The housing authority manages and rehabilitates affordable housing and develops and operates programs for low-income residents. In 1982, the average family income in town stood at $30,000, giving West Hartford a reputation of being wealthy. Average home prices were about $80,000. But almost 30 percent of the 61,000 residents were older than 60. In 1982, second to Hartford, West Hartford had the most elderly poor in the region. Almost 800 West Hartford residents lived on less than $6,000 a year. In 1982, there were three places in West Hartford where the poor elderly could live: privately owned Federation Square with 85 units, and the publicly owned Fellowship Housing with 170 units and Elm Grove housing with 40 units. Over the next six years, builders reconfigured the junior high into housing for the elderly and those with disabilities. Federal, state, and local dignitaries dedicated the new facility in January 1986. In April 2012, officials re-christened the Alfred E. Plant Building with 42 new housing units added to the original 95. The Plant project began in the fall of 2010 with a price tag of $21 million. Alfred E. Plant would be proud. West Hartford governments have long named their public places after local people. Kennedy and Eisenhower Parks aside, local names adorn the schools, parks and public buildings of the town. Knowing the history behind the names reinforces the civic engagement of West Hartford residents; our citizens argue it is this engagement that makes our town so vibrant. William H. Hall and West Hartford in 1902 Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, April 2009 When the Rutherford Building opened in West Hartford Center in 1902, William Hall presented an “Historical Sketch of West Hartford” at the dedication of the building. Hall served as Superintendent and was the unofficial Town Historian. His 28-page speech describes a town based on democracy and cooperation, a town beholden to its forefathers with education as its highest calling. His dedication began with the story of the arrival of the first English settlers to Hartford in 1636. He said that these settlers not only found a beautiful location, but also established a true republic with its Fundamental Orders written in 1638, established by “the people themselves.” Hall knew why Connecticut was called the Constitution State. Hall used Lincoln’s words “of the people, by the people, and for the people” to describe the use of the Town Meeting which worked so well in our community. Hall made a point to recognize the vote by the Hartford settlers to set aside common land for the benefit of all between Quaker Lane and Prospect Avenue. In 1902, Hall marveled that on this stretch of land that large portions of the territory were being used by the Hartford Golf Club, Elizabeth Park and Charter Oak Park, for “the use and benefit of the public.” Hall was interested in civic virtue. Each section of his speech outlined an inheritance of public service, or actions that were for the good of all, not the aggrandizement of the individual. The first government of the town came out of the church. At the annual meeting, a Society Committee of three church members was chosen to run the town. Soon a committee of five took charge of the schools. They later became the Board of School Visitors, and then the Board of Education. The minister was always a member of the school visitors. According to Hall the five Visitors went to a school and then made a “call at one of the taverns for a mug of flip” before moving on to the next school. Hall believed he could characterize West Hartford residents as industrious and thrifty based on the lack of a poor house. Only a few needed public aid each year. Hall editorialized that “the worship of God, and the instruction and training of the children, are fundamental principles in all good government and society.” He believed that there were public schools here as early 1713 when the first church was built. When the town met to build three new school buildings in 1745, the meeting minutes recorded that the committee dispose of the old school houses. One of these buildings was the “old gambrel roofed brick school house,” built around 1745 near the Old Burial Ground on North Main Street. In Hall’s words, “within its walls, on side benches, often in a crowded condition, successive generations of noble and worthy citizens were trained.” On Sundays, the schoolhouse was used for Sunday School classes. “There is no doubt” according to Hall, “that the people of West Hartford, in those days, as in our own time, were public spirited, conformed to good customs, obeyed the laws and improved their privileges, and therefore established schools very early.” Until 1795, the ecclesiastical society took care of the schools. By 1780, there were five schools in town, all on Main Street. Hall believed that one was located in the south end, one near the residence of Paul Thomson (near Park Road) and called the Popple School, because of the numbers of poplar trees, one in the Center, another called the Chestnut Hill School, and finally one in the north end. There were also schools in West Lane, Mountain Street, Prospect Hill and the Quakers ran one school. At that time, West Hartford had a population of about 1000 people, about 125 families. From 1796 until 1855, a School Society, established by the General Assembly to separate church and state, managed the schools. The School Society broke the town into nine school districts. Each one had meetings each year to establish the policy and kept records of those meetings. In West Hartford, citizens actively participated in running the schools. Hall documents that the West District held eight meetings in one year to decide where to build a new schoolhouse. Because students were required to pay for their schooling with wood, the purchase of wood stoves was a big event. The South School District established a committee of three to discuss the purchase of one of these stoves. Schools were open for eleven months a year, in the winter run by male teachers and in the summer by dames or female teachers. Hall records the pay for the men at $42 for 16 weeks and that for a dame (usually the best female scholar at the school) at $9 for nine weeks. In 1845, shareholders started the West Hartford Academy. The 58 stockholders operated a flourishing school through 1865 whose pupils included boarders from out of town. Hall pushed the school district to consolidate and it did so in 1885. Subsequently, the town began to manage the schools. Hall argued that this consolidation led to a marked improvement in the schools. Hall continued to praise the democratic process and the participation of townspeople in the workings of the schools. In his speech’s conclusion he proclaims: Let us not forget, however, that our highest duty, our noblest endeavor, our grandest opportunity and our true success as a community are to be found in such use and improvement of all these advantages and blessings as will result in the training of our children and youth in character and life so that they may most worthily serve God and their fellow men in their day and generation. Hall’s focus on community, hard work, education, and democracy continue to drive the town today when its population is twenty times larger than in 1902. Though the physical manifestations of these values have changed with 15 public school buildings and a Town Council rather than Town Meeting form of government, their importance to the community continue with an active citizenry imbued with civic virtue and education at their core. West Hartford 1905 Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, May 2014 Between 1885 and 1925, more than 80 percent of West Hartford residents had jobs that were not based on farming. The economic nature of the town changed as farming became more specialized, transportation to Hartford improved with the horse trolley, and developers began buying up land and luring Hartford residents out to the suburbs. Yet, even though West Hartford was changing from a farm town to a suburb by 1905, farmers, as well as florists, and gardeners who made their living off the land continued to play a significant role running the town. While it may seem that farmers would carry traditional political and economic values, in fact, those in West Hartford helped to reshape our community. The town grew in the 1890s from 1,920 to 3,186 in 1900 and increased another 60% by 1910 to 4,806. While the town retained its rural look with plenty of land still farmed, the types of farms and variety of jobs of the newcomers to town helped change the character of the town. In 1905, Geer’s City Directory collected information on West Hartford residents, listing their place of residence, their job and its location, and whether they owned their own home. West Hartford’s labor force worked as clerks in Hartford’s insurance industry, as machinists at Pratt and Whitney and as carpenters, civil engineers, and Charter Oak Bank cashiers. The Arnolds ran the Trout Brook Ice and Feed Company on Farmington Avenue and many women worked at St. Mary’s Home on Steele Road. West Hartford residents did white collar work, worked in manufacturing in both Hartford and West Hartford, did artisanal work as harness makers, blacksmiths, masons, and hostlers and did service work as butlers, domestics, drivers, and coachmen. This wide variety of occupations reflected a town making the shift from farm to suburb and in a town in which the wealthier residents employed service workers. The most surprising part of the data is the number of people still involved in working off the land. But, the type of land use varied more as those working the land specialized. Data from the directory reveals that about 12 percent of the workers listed were farmers. In the United States, farmers made up about 38 percent of the workforce in 1900 and 31 percent in 1910. West Hartford was moving away from its rural roots, to a mixed economy. At the same time, those living off the land included gardeners, vegetable gardeners, landscape gardeners, milk dealers and peddlers, florists, farm hands, and tobacco workers. The son of German immigrants, Frank Stadtmueller, was a progressive farmer who advocated a role for farming in 20th century Connecticut and West Hartford. He managed Vine Hill Farm owned by Charles Beach from 1885 to 1915 and invented the idea of “baby’s milk” by testing milk in the lab each day and keeping the cows clean and milkers free from disease. Stadtmueller, who lived on the farm, encouraged farming in West Hartford and encouraged farmers to also run efficient businesses. On his dairy farm, he marketed his product, and he believed that the state played a role as well in inspecting milk, certifying cleanliness, and providing price supports. These changes show that, though there were still many farmers in town, some farmers, at least, saw the benefits of government support and modern marketing techniques. Stadtmueller, in his second role as State Dairy and Food Commissioner, urged farmers to improve distribution of their goods and to cooperate. He urged the government to provide price supports for milk, so that farmers did not give up dairy farming, and sell their lucrative farmland to developers. The Thomson family, James, Paul, Wallace and Jennette owned all four corners of the intersection of Park and South Main where they established a florist business. Paul Thomson was listed as florist at the corner of Park and Main. James, who died by 1909, was the founder of Hartford’s Brown-Thomson department store, and like some other industrialists, moved to what was becoming the suburbs, to establish a “gentleman’s farm.” Wallace Thomson, his son, established the family greenhouses in 1899, providing vegetables and produce to the farmer’s markets throughout the Hartford area. Wallace’s son Pomeroy, went on to Cornell and came back to the West Hartford greenhouses in the early 1930s to grow carnations that sold wholesale and to supply the florist trade. Adjoining the greenhouses, was Thomson’s florist shop. Wallace Thomson, like Stadtmueller, was also involved in town government and served on West Hartford’s first Town Council from 1921 to 1931. Frederick Duffy moved to town in 1900 and bought the old John Whitman House on North Main near Asylum Avenue. Listed as a farmer, Duffy studied and developed a herd of Jersey cows which produced a superior quality of milk and cream. He had these dairy products delivered each day to Hartford families. At the same time, Duffy promoted agriculture in the state and served as a judge at stock exhibits across the country. Duffy served on West Hartford’s School Board and as a member of the first Town Council in 1921. In the 1940s, he headed the West Hartford Housing Authority. A.C. Sternberg and his son farmed at the corner of Sedgwick Road and Mountain Road. He owned the area to the east of the West District School. He had five barns and several houses on his property. From 1895 to 1896 A.C. Sternberg served as the representative to the Connecticut General Assembly from West Hartford. In 1916, a contentious quarrel between farmers and suburbanites over the value of land led to taxpayers rejecting the assessment list. The town could not collect its taxes and had to borrow a year’s expenses. Sternberg headed a seven-member committee which studied the problem and recommended that the town move from the town meeting form of government to a council manager system with a zoning plan to control and encourage development on farmland being put up for sale. While the number of farmers in the country, in Connecticut, and in West Hartford declined, they retained political power. Stadtmueller, Thomson, Duffy and Sternberg all served in elective office in the town and seemed to be a progressive force in the politics of the town. Their dedication to working the land did not necessarily mean their politics were traditional as they were elected to a Town Council manager system of government which was the first in the state of Connecticut. Recalling the Days of Luna Park Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, May 2008 Imagine yourself in West Hartford on June 23, 1906. Luna Park, an amusement park, is set to open on New Park and Flatbush Avenues. You’ve watched the construction and the hiring of more than 100 employees to run the park. You’d heard about the Columbia Exposition in 1893, Coney Island’s Luna Park that opened in 1904, and the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904. This opening is not on that grand a scale, but news articles from the Hartford Courant make allusions to these events. At 2 p.m. on that Saturday afternoon, Governor Henry Roberts officially opened the park, flanked by Hartford’s Mayor Henney and West Hartford’s town selectmen. The Colt Band kicked off the celebration, playing the “Star Spangled Banner,” followed by exploding cannons. There you were, in your hometown of about 5,000 people. Luna Park was Greater Hartford’s “first big metropolitan outdoor place of entertainment” and likely you would have been part of this opening celebration. The Chatford Construction Company from New Haven invested $200,000 to build the park, starting in March 1906. At least 150 workmen built the midway, concessions and rides. The day before the park opened, the men worked until 8 at night when, for the first time, they turned on the 50,000 lights. The Courant said “the illumination was spectacular in the extreme and the White City stood out in the darkness like some magic city flashed into being by the wave of a wizard’s wand.” A crowd had gathered both from the city and surrounding neighborhoods to witness the final touches on the amusement park. The park of pleasure offered a host of entertainment. After paying a 5 cent entrance fee, you could see the Old Mill, Palace of Fun, Fatal Wedding, Streets of India, Ferris Wheel, Photograph Gallery, Snake Charmers, Temple of Mirth, Circle Swing, Penny Arcade, Miniature Railway, Pony Circus, Mammoth Carnival, Helter Skelter, Fortune Tellers, San Francisco Disaster, Rifle Gallery, Japanese Tea Room, Glass Blowers and a big ballroom, the biggest building on the grounds. West Hartford residents were thrilled with the number of construction jobs and then with the work at the park. A May 6, 1906 help wanted ad in the Courant called for 109 employees to be hired at the park including female cashiers, male ticket takers, guides, ticket sellers, scenic car brakemen, Old Mill employees, property men, circus ring employees, hostlers (stablemen), garage men, engineers, electricians, gardeners, watchmen, police, musicians, lecturers, cooks and “colored” nurses. Luna Park shared the property with the Charter Oak Park race track that opened in 1873 at the corner of Flatbush and Oakwood avenues. The 120-acre park, bounded by Flatbush Avenue, Quaker Lane, Prospect Avenue, Talcott Road and Oakwood Avenue, had a one-mile horse racing track. This park put West Hartford on the map of harness racing. Daily trotting races, which climaxed with Race Week over Labor Day, drew thousands to town for the daily summer trotting races and betting ranging from $100 to $20,000. This 1926 map shows signs that the Horse Race Track is no longer in use, and Luna Amusement Park has gone out of business. Its main purpose was for the Connecticut State Agricultural Fair. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. Luna Park drew people to town, too. But the shining new park brought with it problems as well. At the end of May 1906, the Consolidated Railways Company asked the town to make the trolley to Luna Park a double track. The selectmen authorized the company to construct a double track, but it wasn’t ready for the park opening in late June. When the park opened on June 23, there was trouble. On June 26, police discovered three cases of pickpockets who got $75 from their victims. As the Courant put it, “the opening of a large place of amusement like Luna Park naturally draws some from the underworld.” Just three weeks after the park opened on July 15, the Rev. T.M. Hodgdon from the First Church of Christ Congregational, “preached a forceful sermon upon the desecration of the Lord’s Day at Luna Park.” Reverend Hodgdon argued that West Hartford was humiliated in the eyes of neighboring towns for letting Luna Park open on Sunday. Management of the park, he believed, was happy to pay a $50 fine per week. Reverend Hodgdon believed the park could be open on Sunday, but they could not charge admissions fees or run the amusements because the law prohibited the doing of “any secular business or labor, except works of necessity or mercy.” He referred to reports of liquor sales in this dry town and gambling in the neighborhood. According to the newspaper report, while peanut vendors were prosecuted for trespassing at the park, police did not enforce the laws against liquor or gambling. On July 18, Louis Dubrowski was found guilty of trespassing with his peanut and popcorn wagon, which he set up on New Park Avenue at the front of the park property. The rule was that he could not have his cart in one place for more than five minutes. Witnesses claimed he was there from three to five minutes. A court interpreter, who translated from Polish for “the prisoner,” as he was called in the newspaper article, addressed the court saying “the Constitution of the United States allowed everyone to make an honest living and inquired why the gamblers who frequented the Luna Park region were not arrested instead of a poor man with a family to support.” The prisoner was set free as long as he agreed not to go back to Luna Park. Just two days later, a near riot erupted among the immigrant workers trying to finish the trolley tracks. The work to double track the trolley had moved slowly and park officials put pressure on the trolley company to finish their work because it affected the attendance. The trolley company imported a gang of Italians, Hungarians, and Poles from New Haven to work on the Luna Park end of the track while local immigrant men worked on the Sisson Avenue end. The company paid the New Haven men $1.75 per hour while paying the local men $1.50. When the local men did not get a raise, they threatened the New Haven men with violence and there were rumors that the Hartford men had guns. The New Haven men refused to go back to work for fear of their safety. The general manager of New Haven’s Consolidated Railway Company came to the scene accompanied by the West Hartford’s Deputy Sheriff Foote and seven policemen from the Hartford police and surrounded the New Haven workers, making it safe for them to go back to work. If the Hartford men did not go back to work at the old rate, they were told they would lose their jobs. About 30 men returned. The local men not only called for a raise in their pay, but also a decrease in the work day from 10 to 9 hours. The local men did not go to work on July 19. In response, the trolley company brought up another gang of workers from New Haven to complete the job. Was this park “good” for West Hartford? If you were there, you would have felt the excitement of manufactured fun, big crowds and city lights. For town officials, it wasn’t as simple as that. Workers, peanut vendors, immigrant laborers and Sunday amusement seekers pressed the bounds of what was acceptable in a 1906 suburban town. Troup 12 Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, July 2010 In June 2010, Adam Brown and Jeremy Schmitt both earned their Eagle Scout Award from Troop 12 at the First Congregational Church of Christ. Their journey, through more than 20 merit badges, countless weekends of camping, weekly meetings, popcorn sales, weeks at Yawgoog Summer Camp in Rhode Island and the demand to “do a good deed daily” added two more young men to the roster of about 1.8 million who have received this award since 1910. Four percent of those who start in scouting finally earn the award. Jeremy and Adam are part of a strong scouting tradition in West Hartford. Troop 12 was founded in 1910 at the First Church. In 1936, the Universalist Church started Troop 44. Troop 136 is attached to the Westminster Presbyterian Church. Troop 146 began at the Methodist Church in 1941. William H. Hall in his book West Hartford (1930) devoted three pages to “The Boys Brigade and Boy Scout Troop 12.” Minister Thomas Hodgdon of the Congregational Church organized the forerunner of Boy Scout Troop 12, the Boys Brigade, as part of an international organization started in Scotland in 1883. The activities included a mix of military drill, Bible study and camping. By 1905, about 14,000 12 to 18 year old boys across the United States joined the organization. West Hartford’s group was called Company C. The impetus for the group back in Scotland came from a man who had trouble keeping order in his Sunday School classes and who believed that discipline instilled in the young men would help keep them in the church and out of trouble. The original purpose of the Boys Brigade was “the advancement of Christ’s Kingdom among Boys and the promotion of habits of Reverence, Discipline, Self-Respect, and all that tends toward a true Christian Manliness.” Reverend Thomas Hodgdon started the group and 30 boys joined. To be a member, boys had to swear off alcohol, tobacco, and obscene language. They wore military uniforms. Hodgdon met with the boys weekly; the first part of each meeting was religious. Then the boys marched to the old Town Hall on the northwest corner of Main and Farmington, where they performed military drills with dummy rifles. In May, the boys performed their Annual Exhibition Drill and the townspeople came to watch. The best “driller” won a prize after keen competition. On Memorial Day they escorted the veterans to the cemetery. Camping was an important part of the Boys Brigade in Scotland and in West Hartford as well. The boys went to camp for two weeks each June. Two years they went to the Aqueduct on the Farmington River. In 1909 they camped at the Connecticut shore for two weeks. Campers conducted mock battles, played sports and stood guard at night. British Army Maj. Gen. Robert S.S. Baden-Powell, who fought in the war against the Boers in South Africa (1899-1902), saw 7,000 Boys Brigaders drill in Glasgow. He was impressed by their enthusiasm but believed the program could be expanded to include more of what he defined as scouting. When he formed the Boy Scouts in 1910, many Boys Brigades, like West Hartford’s Company C, transformed into Boy Scout troops. Between 1910 and 1913, Connecticut Boy Scout Troop 12 raised $600 to buy lumber and supplies to build a cabin on the old Porter estate on the eastern slope of Talcott Mountain, just west of the Canal Road. Samuel Valentine owned the land and he allowed the boys to build on his property. The cabin had a sleeping loft and a stone fireplace and became known as Camp Valentine. On the 200th anniversary of the First Church in May 1913, officials dedicated the cabin. The cabin was built by the labor of scoutmasters and the Boy Scouts. 150 people gathered including parents and friends of scouts, Campfire Girls and other bicentennial guests. Twenty-two Boy Scouts in uniform lined the veranda of the camp as their leaders related the short history of the troop. Though the Scouts are a religious organization, Troop 12 was established as a non-denominational troop. Reverend Henry B. Roberts dedicated the cabin with the following words: “We dedicate this house for noble uses of the Boy Scouts, their parents, and friends; for the cultivation of the pleasures of comradeship and friendship, for the increase of our knowledge of the birds, the trees, the rocks and the precious things of the earth; for the promotion of mutual helpfulness and the cultivation of deftness of hand, and readiness of heart, to give help and succor to those who are in need of our kindness and assistance; for the honor of our church, the good name of our town, and the increase of true patriotism” At the camp, activities included first aid to the injured, swimming, and hiking all to build character, independence and perseverance. The moving force behind the troop was Rev. Hodgdon who had a son who was a patrol leader. Arthur R. Thompson was appointed scoutmaster in 1911 when the troop formed. Thompson was an explorer and naturalist. In the summer of 1894, he traveled with a group toward the North Pole. He was shipwrecked on the coast of Greenland. In 1898, he took an extended trip to Alaska where he panned for gold. Thompson wrote two books about his adventures and encouraged his troop to have an adventurous spirit. From 1915 to 1928, Dr. Edwin H. Munger served as scoutmaster. He was an enthusiastic leader who trained and drilled the boys efficiently. He studied nature and took the boys on hikes exploring the birds, flowers, trees, ferns, and rocks. On his death, the man who became scoutmaster eulogized Munger by saying “The Town of West Hartford has been exceedingly fortunate in having had a real Scoutmaster in the late Dr. E.H. Munger, for under his guidance Scouting in the Town has taken a very high rank. Troop 12 has been, since its organization in 1911, one of the leading troops in the East, with an average of 31 boys each year registered.” By 1928, 17 years after its founding, Troop 12 had produced 40 Eagle Scouts, an average of more than two per year. Though Camp Valentine is gone, Troop 12 lives on.Their first Eagle Scout ceremony in six years was performed at the church in late June, promoting two scouts to Eagle, one being my son. These boys are part of a long line of young men who persevered to earn the Eagle Scout badge. William Howard Taft comes to West Hartford Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, July 2011 What would you do if the President came to town? The people in West Hartford were faced with that very question in the summer of 1911. William Howard Taft’s visit to the Connecticut State Fair on September 7 mobilized the West Hartford Grange selectmen led by Frederick E. Duffy, the Hartford police and city council, Governor Simeon Baldwin, local citizens and peace activists looking to arbitrate rather than fight about diplomatic issues. Every September, starting in the early 20th century, the Connecticut Fair Association held its harvest fair on the grounds of the Charter Oak Race Track on New Park Avenue. The Fair ran concurrently with Race Week, which started on Labor Day when the most important horse races were run. Luna Park opened on the site in 1906 and attracted the amusement park crowd, who also attended the State Fair. The three attractions pulled in tens of thousands of visitors. Each year, the Connecticut Fair, a private venture established for profit, named one day as Grange Day and encouraged the Grange to find a nationally known speaker. When September 7 was set for Grange Day in 1911, the Connecticut Fair went ahead and secured President William Howard Taft as the speaker. The Grange said that the fair had broken its agreement and declared the engagement off. Taft was in his third year as president, after serving as Teddy Roosevelt’s Vice-President for four years. Taft was a Republican who believed in Progressive ideas. He opposed trusts, and in 1911 brought suits against American Tobacco, Standard Oil, and US Steel. Taft also supported a protective tariff, which the conservative wing of the party supported. For the Grange leadership, Taft’s invitation was anathema. On August 2, West Hartford’s Frederick E. Duffy, a Democrat and executive officer of the State Grange was quoted in the Hartford Times saying “the Grange cannot consistently participate in the reception to be tendered for President Taft when he comes to Hartford. The Grange is opposed to the Reciprocity Idea in all its aspects, and as President Taft has been the leader in that movement the Grange does not care to take part in any event in which he is a guest.” Duffy, who owned Meadowbrook Farm in West Hartford, traveled to Washington earlier in the year to testify in hearings against the Reciprocity Treaty. The 1911 treaty negotiated with Canada’s Liberal government provided for free trade in natural products and the reduction of duties on a variety of other products. In August 1911, the US Congress ratified the treaty but when Canada’s Liberal Government lost the general election in September 1911, the Canadian government never ratified the treaty. When Taft planned his trip to Connecticut, this treaty was much in the news. Duffy believed that free trade would hurt U.S. farmers and Taft should know just how strongly the farmers felt. Duffy said that they meant no slur on Taft, but that Duffy was “very much opposed to the President’s stand on reciprocity.” Most of all, the Grange, who had been representing farmers for over 35 years, believed reciprocity would help the middleman, those who would trade in the increased volume of goods, much more than it would help the farmer. The Connecticut Grange, which began in 1876, tried to support and protect small farmers in their relationship to the state and federal governments. By 1910, there were 25,00 Grangers in Connecticut. But just like in unions, the rank and file did not always agree with the leadership. On the reciprocity question, many Grangers were able to separate their beliefs about Reciprocity and the visit of the President to their town. In local politics, however, Democrat Duffy would not relent. His position led L.J. Masury to resign from the West Hartford Board of Education rather than serve on the board with Duffy because of his active stand against President Taft and his visit. Grangers who went to a Field Day at Lake Compounce on August 25 also expressed their opinion about Taft coming to the Connecticut State Fair. Some in the Grange wanted to boycott the Fair because of Taft’s presence but many claimed not to be opposed to the President himself. Meanwhile, town and city governments rolled into action. On August 8, Hartford’s Board of Police Commissioners discussed Taft’s visit to the Connecticut Fair. The Hartford Police Department had jurisdiction over Charter Oak Park even though it was in West Hartford. The police regularly stood at the gates and patrolled inside the park. With the President’s planned visit, the cost of police protection at the West Hartford site increased even more. Hartford’s Board of Commissioners questioned their role in West Hartford. Newspaper articles claimed that other for-profit organizations had to pay for their own police protection, but not the Connecticut Fair Association This issue would not be resolved until West Hartford had its first paid police eight years later. Just ten days before Taft’s arrival, West Hartford’s selectmen resolved that they should develop a committee whose purpose it was to prepare the town to officially welcome Taft. The Selectmen named Judge William Case the chairman of the committee of 192 men. Frederick Duffy was notably missing from the list of the town elite. By time September rolled around, West Hartford closed schools for the Thursday Taft visited to allow the children to visit the Connecticut Fair and see the President On September 7, Taft arrived in Hartford’s Union Station from Boston on his private railway car. Democratic Governor Simeon Baldwin met him and led the opening ceremonies and the parade as they rode in an automobile from the train station to the newly opened Supreme Court and State Library building where he had lunch among Connecticut’s finest. The car then took he and his entourage including U.S. Attorney General George Wickersham to the Fair where Taft delivered his speech to an estimated 30,000 people who completely filled the Charter Oak Race Track from fence to fence. Taft made a nod to those at the fair, saying that farmers increasingly needed to use the scientific principles in farming to increase the value of farmland. He noted that in Connecticut with two representatives from each town in the General Assembly that farmers had a particular hold on political power. Then he moved into the topic of his speech: the “duty of the American nation to promote worldwide peace.” On August 3, 1911, the United States, France and Britain signed a series of treaties on international arbitration to settle international disputes. Taft’s excitement and interest in this topic came at a time of militarization in Europe, and imperialism in Central and Latin America. In Taft’s speech he used arguments that would appear again eight years later when the Senate debated the Versailles Treaty. Taft spoke of permanent peace to relieve nations of preparation for war. He believed tariffs could be arbitrated and that these negotiations would not take away power from the U.S. Senate. Just three years later a “war to end all wars” broke out in Europe. For September 7, 1911, West Hartford focused on the visit of the President. As Taft was whisked back to his personal train car, and taken back to Boston and then his summer home in Beverly, Massachusetts, West Hartford’s residents were left to mend their political disagreements, think about a professional police force, enjoy the rest of Race Week, and perhaps, dream of international peace. Mary Beach’s trip to the Mediterranean Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, August 2001 Just back from a classical tour of Greece, I was fascinated to reach back in the files of the Noah Webster House and find Mary Beach’s 102-page diary of a tour she took in the Mediterranean in early 1912. Mary, born in 1858, was the third of three daughters and two sons of Charles M. Beach, a Hartford merchant in dyes and chemicals and a gentleman farmer in West Hartford. Mary’s ability to take a three-month trip to Europe in 1912 at age 54, rested to a great degree on the business accomplishments of her father. Charles M. Beach’s success allowed him to move to West Hartford in 1859 when he bought the land on the northeast corner of New Britain Avenue and South Main Street, stretching east to Quaker Lane. He established a farm, run scientifically, that produced the first sterilized cow’s milk suitable for babies, called “babies’ milk.” Charles M.’s success on Vine Hill Farm in business and agriculture led to a very comfortable life for him and his family. Mary took her first trip to Europe at age 20, in 1878. Though we have no written record from this trip, her 1912 diary notes that she was at Solfaterra, Italy at the site of an active volcano which she found “much more wonderful than when I was here 34 yrs. ago – and even more scary!” Her trip at age 20 was part of a new movement among the upper class to send daughters on the grand tour to complete their education. Mary Beach’s diary entry of February 22, 1912 describes her visit to Cairo – which she found depressing. She tells of visiting the mummies of Rameses II and a drive along the side of the Nile with views of the Pyramids. She describes riding a camel for the first time. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. We often think that “in the old days” people were not as mobile as we are today with airplanes, busses, and high-speed ferries, but Mary’s trip from January 10 to April 30, 1912 constituted a grand tour of the Mediterranean, the envy of any modern traveler. Tourism as an industry began to appear in the United States in the late 19th century. As wealth accumulated with industrialization and people were able to separate work from family, the middle and upper classes had distinct periods of vacation time. In 1910, President Taft suggested that a vacation should be two to three months long. People agreed that the pressures of modern life necessitated an annual vacation. Spurred by paintings and photographs of the west and the growth of national parks, and the transcontinental railroad completed in 1869, travel in the United States grew into an industry. In the two decades before World War I, an estimated 200,000 upper class Americans traveled to Europe each year. Travel agencies could be counted on to make all the necessary arrangements for transatlantic crossings and Continental tours that cost between $400 and $600. At this time, an average male factory worker made, at most, $1,000 per year. Mary Beach’s trip began in New York City on January 10, 1912 aboard the SS Adriatic. She traveled with a group that included her sisters Edith and Frances. After nine days on the Atlantic, they arrived in the Azores where she was “delighted with the quaint town –- so clean &amp; fresh &amp; yet so mediaeval with many town street gates and arches, &amp; elaborate stucco doorways.” The group then went to Madeira, Gibraltar, Algiers, Nice, Genoa, Naples, Cairo and the Aswan Dam, Jerusalem, Constantinople, Athens, Corinth, Naples, Pompeii, Amalfi, Sorrento, Rome (at Easter), and northern Italy before returning home after a full three months. Mary’s trip, like those in the 21st century, included sightseeing, shopping, and learning. When she left Egypt, she noted, “None of us cared for Alexandria nor for Port Said, except that at the latter shopping was good and reasonable.” At Constantinople, Mary noted that at the Hippodrome she saw a “broken twisted bronze column, which once supported the famous tripod of the Priestess of Delphi of which Miss Hamilton [Edith Hamilton’s Mythology] had told me when I was a child of 8 or 9.” Mary’s classical education was reinforced by her travel. On trips like Mary’s, the sites were important, but the dynamics of the group also added to the trip. “The next morning March 8 we reached Piraeus and just after lunch E.B. (Edith, her sister) and I took a run up to Athens and photographed the Acropolis from the street on the further side. Had not time to climb. On my return I bought Mr. O. a 3p. box of matches with a picture on it of the Acropolis, etc. and found he had bought me a jar of honey from Hymettus (strained) which is very delicate and yet highly flavored and which we are greatly enjoying. It is not overrated at all. Thought continually of F.B. White and his love of the place.” Traveling provided a milieu in which to build relationships, which she might not have back home. On returning to Athens after visiting Constantinople, the tour took them to the Acropolis as well as to the countryside. Mary was interested in both antiquities and the present day situation in Greece. Upon arriving, she wrote “Drove this morning &amp; saw modern Athens with its handsome public building copying the ancient style; one of the finest cities we have seen, Byron’s monument, the beautiful modern stadium (for the 1896 Olympics).” She noted the ongoing archaeological work: “excavations are begun on the Roman market place [next] to the Forum which are to extend to the base of the Acropolis and to be turned into a public park. The Archaeological Soc. have both and expect to pull down all the modern houses (all of a humble sort) in this portion of the city to carry out this place.” She also noted the quaintness of what she considered traditional life. “On the edge of the sea, we saw a most picturesque sight of a peasant and his wife and daughters with a large herd of goats, sheep, 2 donkeys and sheep herder dogs. The man with his short petticoats, the woman and girls with crooks and yellow handkerchiefs, trying to make a goat give its newborn twin kids their dinner. We tumbled out of the carriage and tried to get photos. The family were very fine &amp; noble looking, with attractive manners, at first even refusing the money we offered after posing for us. We were delighted with them.” Mary Beach’s tour must have made West Hartford look new and small when she returned. The town had about 5,000 people and was becoming more of a suburb, but its oldest buildings were but 250 years old. She did not feel that she would keep up with any of the “fellow travelers” in her group when she got home, but her outlook on the world must have been altered by these three months. In the past 50 years, travel has been democratized by being more accessible to more of the population, but trips like that of Mary Beach in 1878 and 1912 set a standard for vacations and tourism. Women Win the Right to Vote Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, January 2010 On November 12, 1920, just after the first national election in which all United States women had the right to vote, Katherine Ludington, President of the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association spoke at a meeting commemorating 50 years of activism. With the national suffrage amendment just three months old, she proclaimed “not paper imitations of citizens but women of purpose and practical information will be the result of the citizenship campaign the association is to conduct.” She proclaimed that the CWSA would build a state organization that would be a “non-partisan civic organization—a league of women voters.” West Hartford women in the late 1910s and 1920s got involved in the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association and the newly formed League. West Hartford was a rapidly developing suburban town of about 9,000 people, the population almost doubling in the previous World War I decade. Many of the families who moved from Hartford to West Hartford during this time period held white-collar jobs at Hartford’s growing insurance companies. West Hartford’s Mary S. Deming held leadership roles in the suffrage movement and the League of Women Voters and ran for election to West Hartford’s new Town Council in 1922. Like most women involved in women’s rights, she took her role as citizen seriously, and got involved in many different issues between 1918 and 1922. Mary E. Smith married William Deming sometime between 1916 and 1918. William became a secretary of Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company in 1906 at age 49. He had been employed since 1875 when he first got a job, straight from high school, as a clerk. He belonged to the Hartford Golf Club, the Hartford Club, the Twentieth Century Club, the Republican Club, and the Hartford Yacht Club. His first wife died in 1909 of typhoid fever at age 52 at their summer home in Sachem’s Head, Guilford. He owned a home at 47 Highland Street in West Hartford. Mary Deming’s first mention in the Hartford Courant is on July 30, 1918, 14 months after the United States entered World War I. She was in charge of enrolling the first group of women as nurses to enlist at Liberty College in Hartford’s City Hall Square. The Hartford Courant noted that some women were married, most were employed, and the women represented many ethnic and socio-economic groups. Deming was in charge of the booth that recruited the nurses. When the United States entered World War I, suffragists around the country wondered if they should jump into the war effort if they themselves were denied the rights of citizenship. In Connecticut, the great majority of women involved in the suffrage movement believed that their aid in the war effort would help change President Woodrow Wilson’s mind about woman suffrage and speed along the movement. Deming knew that citizenship included more than the vote and she jumped into the war effort at the very start. In April 1919, Mary Deming appeared in a Hartford Courant photograph with eleven other women as one of the “Suffrage Workers for Liberty Loan.” Even after the war ended in November 1918, the federal government needed to borrow money from its citizens to pay for the war through the sale of liberty bonds. In January 1919, the Social and Personal section of the Courant showed Mrs. Deming resuming her Monday, Wednesday Friday Red Cross classes in First Aid. Her interest in health was useful during wartime. Mary S. Deming, also written about as Mrs. William H. Deming, was involved in the leadership of the suffrage movement. She led fundraising in Hartford County and raised $100,000 in May 1919. The point of the campaign was to raise money for citizenship work and public services to be offered by the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association. Many men and women not actively involved in the suffrage movement jumped in to help out. Deming helped to formulate the campaign that sought subscriptions from individuals from every community in the state during the second week of June 1919. Team captains reported daily on their progress. She helped organize each county for the work. This type of grassroots campaigning continues to mark the work of the League of Women Voters. Right after this campaign, Mr. Deming died at the end of June 1919. He was 61 years old. Mary, now a widow, continued her political work. When women won the right to vote in August 1920, Mary continued her political work. She moved, as most women did, to affiliate with the League of Women Voters. She became chair of the Legislative Committee, and spent much time at the state capitol, following bills through hearings. Authors Nicholas Kristoff and Shirley WuDunn in their new book, Half the Sky (2009), argue that the woman’s right to vote, led to a elected officials paying attention to their new female constituents. They particularly point to the passage of the Shepard-Towner Act (1922) for maternal and infant care as part of their evidence. Deming was part of these new voters. On March 18, 1922, she wrote a letter to the Hartford Courant in support of the Shepard-Towner Bill, which would provide federal moneys for maternal and infant health. The Courant, a Republican newspaper, opposed the Act, worried about federal intrusion into what they considered to be a local issue. Deming countered by using statistics that 200,000 babies died in 1919 in the United States and 20,000 mothers died in childbirth. She called this a “national disgrace.” The United States ranked 7th among 20 developed nations in the death rate of children under one and 17th on the list of maternal mortality. Deming countered the Courant editors’ fear of federal aid saying that it was a 50:50 proposition with the federal government and state governments splitting the cost. She argued that the Courant supported the Good Roads Act under which Connecticut accepted over two million dollars for good roads, and she believed that the state should be willing to accept money for maternal and infant health. Connecticut stood to gain $45,000 for maternal and infant health over the period of two years. She assured readers that a state agency would administer the act. Later in 1922, Deming and one other women were candidates running for Town Council. According to the Courant, “she has been interested in politics for some time and attended sessions of the Legislature as chairman of the legislative committee of the League of Women Voters.” Though neither woman won, they exercised their rights as a citizen in getting in the race. Like the first women who were finally elected in West Hartford in the 1960s, her League experience pushed her to take part in the public world. The League of Women Voters of Greater Hartford has been working feverishly over the past six months to put together a display on the 90-year history of the Connecticut League since it began November 1920. Go visit the Legislative Office Building in the month of January 2010 and you will learn how the League defined active citizenship. The Greater Hartford Chapter has been active over the past 90 years. They work to be sure that women do not just exercise their right of citizenship at the ballot box. They work to insure that voters, both men and women, are informed, run for office, and lobby their representatives. Their issues change with the times, but their bipartisan movement, remains to make people good citizens and make sure government is of, by, and for the people. Look at Mary Deming’s example 90 years ago. American School for the Deaf Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, October 2011 After ten years of discussions, the American School for the Deaf is razing its iconic Gallaudet Hall and erecting a new building in its place. Since 2009, the main building at the American School for the Deaf, with its 175,000 square feet of space, was limited by health and safety officials because it had deteriorated to a point where it was unsafe for students. Executive Director Ed Pelletier wants to build a new 60,000 square foot facility for $20 million that will better serve the needs of the school. Pelletier argued that rehabbing Gallaudet Hall will cost $45 million. In 1914, officials from the American School for the Deaf began to plan the new building which became Gallaudet Hall. The buildings on Asylum Avenue in Hartford were old and not fireproof and the directors of the school worried about getting students out in case of a fire. They were concerned about the mobility of the “defective children” who could not hear. When they looked for a new site, they wanted it to be big enough to teach the boys how to farm, which according to a Hartford Courant article in November 1920, was a “vocation which as deaf mutes, they were most fitted to follow.” On August 4, 1917, officials from the American School for the Deaf recorded the transfer of 92 acres of land on North Main Street just north of Fern Street for $30,000. On May 10, 1918, the Hartford Courant reported that the school would not move from its 690 Asylum Avenue (where Asylum and Farmington split) location until after the Great War ended. When the land was bought in 1917, the directors estimated it would cost $350,000 to build the new building, based on labor and building conditions. They planned to build it for 200 students. On March 12, 1919, representatives of ASD in Hartford appeared before the Appropriations Committee to get their support for $300,000 to build the Hall. The American School for the Deaf was incorporated in 1816 after a petition signed by 63 citizens made its way to the legislature. In 1816, the state gave the school $5,000. The school opened in 1817 with seven students and became the first permanent school for deaf in the United States. In 1819, Congress gave ASD 22,000 acres of land, which they sold to build the school on Asylum Avenue. The original building was completed in 1821. At its original site, the school was “in the country.” But by 1919, it was surrounded by buildings. The school planned to sell its building and land in Hartford, to build Gallaudet Hall at an estimated cost of $500,000. According to Trinity Professor Henry A. Perkins, who was President of ASD, “the present ones [buildings] are antiquated, the new buildings will be fireproof. Other states will probably withdraw their pupils as they build schools of their own,” if the state would not appropriate the money. On May 13, 1919, Governor Marcus Holcomb signed a bill to provide $250,000 to build the school and to equip it. Two days later, the Hartford Fire Insurance Company bought the Asylum Avenue building from ASD directors for $250,000. Hartford Fire planned to raze the building within four months. When the state appropriated the $250,000 for building the new school, they had to approve the plans that included a fireproof brick building, with a “maximum of light and convenience.” According to Professor Perkins from Trinity who was chair of the ASD Board, the “new building will be of attractive appearance, although it will not be ornamental to any great extent.” The architectural firm Isaac A. Allen, Inc. of Hartford designed a colonial style building. It set a trend for the buildings later built in the center of town including Hall High School, which is the present town hall building built in 1924, the Town Hall and Noah Webster Library built in the mid 1930s and the First Congregational Church built in the 1940s. The cornerstone was laid on July 22, 1920. As they built the building, right at the end of World War I, they had much difficulty getting materials. Tile ordered in June 1919 arrived 10 months later. In March 1921, the trustees asked the legislature for an additional $100,000 because of cost overruns. The building committee wanted the new building to be “substantial, durable, and reasonably attractive.” The architects planned for an imposing three-storied administration building with 286 feet frontage, and 40-foot depth. The two wings of three stories held classroom buildings and the south wing had a covered passageway to connect it to a separate building for the primary grades. Attached to the north wing were the heating plant, boilers, workshops, and laundry. The structure included two grassy courtyards between the two wings of the main building, which separated the dining room. The kitchen was built as a separate building. The administrative building had a reception room, executive offices, library, 11 classrooms, a club room (one for girls and one for boys), locker rooms, and toilet facilities. The second floor included 14 classrooms, a study hall for girls and one for boys, a room for a supervisor and a matron, and the girls’ dorms in the south and the boys’ dorms in the north wing. The assembly hall over the dining hall was two stories, had a stage, was set up to show movies, and could seat 250 people. Above the kitchen were “women servants’” quarters. On the third floor was an infirmary, and living quarters for nurses and attendants. It included an art room, three sewing rooms, a room for a cooking class, and six more dorm rooms for teachers or students. In March 22, 1922, Governor Templeton dedicated the buildings which served the school well for almost 90 years. In 2011, architect Tai Soo Kim will design the new building which will be located to the east of Gallaudet Hall. When it is completed, Gallaudet Hall will be taken down and architects and landscapers will design a quad in between the new building and the gym. The cupola from Gallaudet Hall will sit in the middle of this quad. For members of the ASD community, the decision to raze Gallaudet Hall has been long and agonizing. But the realities of the 21st century technology and the changes in ASD students have led them to this decision. When Gallaudet Hall was built in 1921, most of the students who attended the school became deaf after they learned language. In the 21st century, almost all ASD students are born deaf with multiple obstacles to learning added onto their deafness. This new building will be able to serve these students more effectively. "],
["world-war-i-era.html", "World War I Era West Hartford and World War I West Hartford Women during World War I Edith Beach’s Influence on West Hartford New Departure Plant in Elmwood", " World War I Era West Hartford and World War I Originally appeared in Joseph M. Donahue, The Connecticut Veterans Memorial West Hartford (2006). Of the 314 West Hartford citizens who fought in World War I, 292 made it back home. Twenty-two men died according to the war memorial on the east side of the West Hartford Town Hall. The United States likes to believe it played a pivotal role in the Great War. U.S. casualties equaled about one percent of the 10 million killed during the war. Testimony to the small sacrifice Americans paid compared to the British, French, Russians, and Germans is that the first West Hartford man died in battle on October 4, 1918 just five weeks before the five year war ended. Statistics on 14 casualties reveal that three men died in September, eight in November, and three in March of 1919. Of the 14, only four died of battle wounds. In 1918, West Hartford had a population of about 8,000 people. About 15 percent of the men in town served in the war. The first call for men to sign up for the draft, required men between the ages of 22 and 35 to report. When the government asked, in September 1918 for men to register for the draft, it called for all men between the ages of 18 and 46. In West Hartford, at the Town Hall, then located in the old Congregational Church building on the northwest corner of Main and Farmington Avenue, they had three interpreters there to translate in French, Swedish and Italian. The West Hartford men who went off to “keep the world safe for democracy” were a mixed bunch and reflected the diversity of the town over 80 years ago. One young man who served, Pietro Bradinini, arrived in France on October 4, 1918 and served in the motor corps. Both Adolphe Brodeur and Rudolf Krieger probably fought against former countrymen from Germany. The October 22, 1918 meeting minutes of West Hartford’s War Bureau reported that F.S. Echols of Walbridge Road, a neighborhood with larger homes in the east end was killed in battle. Frank Velhage, whose family owned a farm near the present day Charter Oak School was the son of French Canadian immigrants. Today the American Legion Hall is named after him. Clarence Scarborough also served in the war. His parents lived in the colonial Colton house on Sedgwick Road not too far from South Main Street. The Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society retains a file of all people who fought in World War I. Sgt. Adolphe Brodeur was called back from the Mexican border, fighting Pancho Villa, to enter the fighting in the world war Great War. He saw fighting at Chateau Thierry, St. Mihiel, and Meuse Argonne. He was gassed on November 1, 1918 and found to be 10 percent disabled by the government. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society, World War I Collection. Walter O. Korder, the artist who painted the history mural in the Old Hall High Library, the nursery rhymes at Charter Oak, and the portrait of Frederick U. Conard, in Conard’s library, also served in World War I. World War I was the first to allow women to officially serve in the military. Four women from West Hartford served: Ida Butler, Dorothy Dressler Carpenter, Beatrice Cook, and Mary Rees. After six months of training in New Haven and Boston, Carpenter served as a Reconstruction aide at Fort Dix in New Jersey, helping amputees in 1919 re-adjust to civilian life. Making the world safe for democracy led to a draft which is not so democratic. President Wilson ran on a platform of keeping us out of war. But when the time came, he got the Office of War Information going to convince men that they should sign up. This draft, unlike that of the Civil War, did not allow men to buy substitutes. People of all economic strata had to sacrifice for the greater good, as defined by the wartime government. West Hartford Women during World War I Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, May 2001 When the United States entered World War I, women’s role helping to win the war at home transformed the home front. Women’s domestic duties took on political overtones. Proper food preparation became a patriotic duty and domestic skills like knitting became another way to win the war. Women got the chance to publicly organize and work alongside men in ways not accepted during peacetime. For the first time in U.S. History, women officially enlisted in the armed forces. Of the 314 West Hartford citizens who served, four were women. Ida Butler, Dorothy Dressler Carpenter, Beatrice Cook, and Mary A. Rees all served. For instance, Carpenter served as a Reconstruction Aid at Fort Dix in New Jersey in 1919 helping amputees learn how to manage in civilian life. Most women in West Hartford participated in the war by helping the men overseas and by sacrificing on the home front. On West Hartford’s War Bureau, women used their skills in the public and private worlds. Seven of the 20 people on the committee at its first meeting November 21, 1917, were women. The Secretary, Mary Buckland, contacted all the “boys” in the service from West Hartford. She wrote a letter to each one, telling them that the Bureau would keep in touch with them and “render every possible service…” so that “we may all have the opportunity to demonstrate to you, to the best of our ability, our deep appreciation of your sacrifice for your country and for the ones at home.” The federal government did not impose rationing or price controls during World War I, but it did urge people to voluntarily conserve. The West Hartford War Bureau established a Conservation Committee in February 1918 to address rising prices and shortages. In February, Chairman of the committee, Mrs. Newlands, who had recently attended a State Council meeting at the Capitol, reported that the cost of yarn had skyrocketed. Members attempted to control the price by buying the yarn through the War Bureau. War Bureau members also worried about the use of gasoline by delivery trucks. The War Bureau asked merchants, like those at Burnham’s Grocery in the center of town to make just one delivery per day, saving both men and gasoline. The Conservation Committee also urged the people to “carry their own bundles” rather than expect delivery. By October of 1918, the West Hartford Branch of the Red Cross had sewing, knitting, and surgical dressing departments. They opened their rooms every day except Saturdays from December 1917 to August 1918. From then on, they opened Tuesday and Thursday. With a total population of less than 9,000, West Hartford women produced 1,225 pairs of socks on the five knitting machines. Nearly 400 women knit by hand and made 1,143 garments during the year. Most of these items were sent to the U.S. soldiers, weathering a tough winter in northeastern France. The surgical dressing department made 52,439 dressings through July. Members of the Sewing Department operated six sewing machines and made 3,217 garments. Women at the Elmwood Library Club and the North End Auxiliary also contributed to these totals. It seemed like the war effort reached everyone. The Civilian Relief Committee, made up of three women officers and four men on the executive committee, divided the town into nine districts. Each district had a captain and assistant workers to thoroughly canvas the town for records of all men in service in the Army or Navy. By February of 1918, the Committee collected 145 names. The workers encouraged the families to buy War Risk Insurance, the first mass sale of life insurance in U.S. History. This canvas also helped on the Liberty Loan Drives. The United States raised one-quarter of the money needed to fight the war through selling war bonds. The government sponsored four Liberty Loan Drives. Both men and women went door to door to sell them. Children in schools bought stamps and filled their books. When they were full, they turned the books in for a bond. The Fourth Liberty Loan Drive, to begin November 11, 1918, included efforts by the YWCA, Knights of Columbus, War Camp Community Fund, Jewish Relief, Public Library, and Salvation Army. The citizens also organized community activities to raise money for the bond drives. The Women’s Committee put together a cookbook and raised $43.75 to donate to the bond drive. For the Third Liberty Loan Drive, West Hartford had a quota of $469,000 and raised $604,000. The Chairman of the committee, W.S. Griswold, praised the Women’s Committee for its help in raising the money. Another way women got involved in the war effort was through the Home Garden and Food Production Committee. Certain processed foods could easily be sent overseas. The federal government urged citizens to grow Liberty Gardens and can their own food so that it could maximize the amount of food sent overseas. In 1917, the Town gave $7,000 to this committee to buy a thresher and reaper to assist the farmers in town. The Connecticut agricultural extension taught classes in canning. With the advent of factory canning, many women had lost the art, but with the war, the government taught women once again how to do this. In 1917, Connecticut led all states in the union in community canning work by canning over 25,000 quarts of produce “by the community method.” On Thanksgiving Day 1918, after Armistice Day, a directive from the State Council of Defense told people what they should eat on Thanksgiving Day. The State Council sent a directive to the public reminding them, that even though the war was over, there were 180 million people in Europe either “ground down by the iron heel of Germany” or who suffered greatly during the war. The directive urged women “to make yours a real dinner of Thanksgiving and not a feast.” They recommended that women use home-grown or Connecticut grown products, that they not to use food that could be shipped to the “hungry millions,” and they not plan more food than was “needed for a comfortable meal.” Beef, butter, sugar, and canned vegetables and fruits could all be sent overseas. Women’s civic responsibility, according to the government, was to “show these millions that they may still have confidence in America.” The Great War, as experienced by West Hartford’s women, offered an elevated role for their domestic duties and new possibilities for public action. Historians often ask whether the changes brought by the war led to lasting changes in gender roles. Because much of the government rhetoric asked women to do this work as a sacrifice for the war effort, when the war ended, much that was gained was then lost. However, no one could take away the experiences of independence, responsibility or recognition they received for helping to win the war. Edith Beach’s Influence on West Hartford Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, April 2008 Edith Beach, aged 54, is listed in the 1910 U.S. Census with an occupation of “none.” This is not too surprising for an upper class woman at the turn of the 20th century, but for a historian, this word masks the life of Beach and many women like her who had an impact on their community. Edith’s father, Charles Beach, was the head of West Hartford’s Red Cross War Bureau during the Great War from 1917 to 1918. Beach led a committee of about 20 people and the group coordinated volunteer activities, sent condolences to families who lost young men in service and ran the Liberty Loan campaigns to get people to buy bonds to support the war effort. In the October 22, 1918 War Bureau meeting minutes, the committee voted for Miss Edith Beach and Miss Mary Beach to be “made members of the War Bureau.” The Misses Beach, including their sister Frances, had run a “French Market” at the Vine Hill Farm on October 12 which attracted 1,180 people and raised $56,938.62 (equivalent to about $1 million today). Getting a thousand people out of a population of about 6,500 and raising about $9 per West Hartford resident seemed to be quite a feat. West Hartford’s French Market, organized by Edith Beach and her sisters Mary and Frances, answered the call from President Wilson for a Columbus Day patriotic celebration and to raise funds by selling bonds for the “Fourth Liberty Loan Drive.” The market ran from noon to 9 p.m. on October 12. Beach wrote that this Market “demonstrates the adaptability of women to a class of work which has heretofore been monopolized by men.” Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. What attracted people to the farm and how did Edith Beach come to run the French Market? Charles Beach first bought land in West Hartford 1859. The head of Beach Brothers Company, a chemical and dye making company in Hartford, Beach summered in a house on South Main Street just northeast of New Britain Avenue. He built one of the biggest dairy farms in Connecticut after buying out six farms on the four corners of New Britain Avenue and South Main. He owned clear down to Trout Brook. Charles Beach hired Frank Stadtmueller to run the farm. They produced “baby’s milk” with over 200 cows, by cleaning up the farm, the cows, the barns, the tools, and the milk pails. “Baby’s milk” was shipped in bottles by train all over and gave Vine Hill its reputation. More than 30 men worked on the farm in its heyday before the Great War, taking care of the cows and the 12 work horses, working the grist mill, bottling milk, making cream and butter, cutting ice from the pond, and working in the blacksmith shop. Many of these men boarded in what is now the Sarah Whitman Hooker House museum on the southeast corner of New Britain and Main. After Charles Beach died in 1910, and with the build up to the Great War, production on the farm declined. Farm hands became factory workers, Bloomfield’s Woodford Farm took over production of baby’s milk, and production declined. In 1910, Edith, her two sisters, her brother Charles Beach and his two children, an Irish servant and a German servant all lived in the huge house their father built, now situated on Brightwood Lane. It is in this context that Edith organized the French Market. Up until this time, she had been involved in many activities acceptable to upper class women. She and her sisters never married, but did help raise their nephews as their sister-in-law died in childbirth. Edith tutored young Teddy and took him on drives through town. She took driving lessons in 1905 and was one of the first women in West Hartford to own a car. Her daily diary serves as more of a chronicle than a reflective journal, but a day in January 1902 included luncheon with Mrs. Washburn and Mrs. Bingham, framing photographs she had taken, sewing and working on a stole. On that day she received letters from Bishop Donne and Mrs. Elizabeth Colt. She also wrote a report to the newspapers on the work of the Visiting Nurses, a group for which she gave many volunteer hours. When President Wilson called for towns to raise money for the Liberty Loan and Red Cross Drives, Edith Beach was there to help. In May 1918, she and 75 West Hartford women organized a drive to raise $10,000 for the Second Red Cross War Fund. The campaign kicked off on May 20th with an automobile parade through the principal residential portion of the town. The cars were decorated with the “Stars and Stripes,” the colors of the Allied Countries and with Red Cross banners. Even though the wealthy East Side of town was rolled into the Hartford campaign, the women still believed they could make their goal. On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, the 75 women, divided into 14 teams, each headed by a woman who owned a car, canvassed every home in town. With a population of 6,500, they got 2,400 pledges and contributions. They raised $12,100, going 21% over their goal. Those who reported on the drive believed that the “percentage to total residents equal, if not better, than any town in the country.” Their unparalleled success was most likely helped by the passage of the Sedition and Espionage Acts in 1917 and 1918. These laws allowed officials to arrest people who spoke out against the war. Perhaps refusing to buy bonds could be construed as an anti-war stance. When Edith organized the French Market in October 1918, she was responding to President Woodrow Wilson’s call for a Columbus Day patriotic celebration, and his call for bond money to give to “Food for France” and to the Fourth Liberty Loan Drive. Edith borrowed the strategy of the summer drive and divided the town into 11 sections and her teams led a canvass of every house in town. The canvassers sold tickets to the French Market for 25 cents each and asked for donations to the market which included canned goods, preserves, a pig, and fruit. At the market, the Beaches set up 12 booths with the donated articles. They arranged for seven speakers, five of whom were soldiers, and a nine-piece band. Vine Hill Farm was transformed to look like a French Market. The automobile corps transported people to the market. Edith Beach led the drive with 86 women volunteering to help. The highpoint of the afternoon was a pageant known as the Marseillaise Battalion. There on the corner of Main and New Britain Avenue, Beach’s friend Inez Temple produced a “dramatic incident of the French Revolution when the national anthem of the French attained its fame.” In Beach’s write up of the drive, she wrote that the organization of the drive “is not only an interesting story but demonstrates the adaptability of women to a class of work which has heretofore been monopolized by the men.” Beach’s activities, at age 61, put her in a public sphere that showed women’s patriotism and a role that far exceeded the delineation of “none” as found in the census. Wartime often altered the roles of men and women and the Great War was no exception. For Beach, the community building led to her running New York City’s YMCA just four years later. Historians have to wonder how much of her public activity was caused by her father’s death and how much by her own sense of independence and feminism. New Departure Plant in Elmwood Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, February 2013 On Thursday, September 9, 1915 the New Departure Plant Superintendent Charles M. Gearing fired three men, Dewey Cavnaugh, Alfred Arnold, and Arthur Lishay for refusing to work overtime that night. On Friday, September 10, 1915, seven cup and cone grinders walked off the job and joined the three men at the New Departure Plant in Elmwood to protest the firing and demand better working conditions. The workers posted placards in the factory, announcing that, whatever concessions were made to the employees of the main Bristol New Departure factories would apply in Elmwood by September 14. The Bristol shops began a 9 hour day schedule, with the same pay as for 10 hours. The New Departure Superintendent promised to reduce the workweek to 5 ½ days. This event tells much about the situation with labor in the early 20th century and provides a small window into life in industrial Elmwood about 100 years ago. The story of this small labor action, so carefully reported by the Hartford Courant, displayed the pro-business leaning of the paper in the early 1900s. The story is full of working conditions, gender and machine tools. Labor unrest permeated Connecticut’s work culture in 1915. Workers went on strike more than 1,200 times and employers locked them out of factories over 150 times over the course of the year. At the same time as the Great War broke out in Europe, and the number of European immigrants declined, manufacturing and the machine tool industry boomed in Connecticut. Workers felt a power they had not experienced before as they exercised what they saw as their right to demand better wages, better hours and better working conditions from their employers. Before the National Labor Relations Act (1935) workers could not make their employers negotiate; going on strike took a lot of courage. The ten New Departure grinders hoped that 60 male grinders and 30 female grinders would follow them out on Saturday to reinforce their demands for a reduction in the work day from ten hours to nine hours, and a 10% increase in wages. They wanted half day Saturdays and time and a half for overtime over 55 hours. According to the Hartford Courant’s report, Superintendent Charles M. Gearing, who had been on the job for a year, described that the three working men were attempting to stir up trouble. The sixty grinders did not go out on strike, he said. And, because the original three strikers were unruly, Geary paid them off and dismissed them. Those who went on strike worked cup and cone grinding machines. These machine tools made the cups and cones that were integral parts of the bicycle hub. The grinders worked their grinding machine with a wooden foot treadle. According to the Courant article, and the accompanying photograph from the Connecticut Historical Society, women were also grinders. Starting in 1909, the Connecticut State Legislature’s Joint Standing Committee on Labor held hearings on a bill that would deny women the right to be polishers and grinders. Middle Class reformers, the Metal Polishers Union, state industrial investigators all testified that this work was too difficult for women and that it affected their health far beyond the health of men. Little bits of metal in the air, they argued, caused workers to get tuberculosis, and at that time, they believed tuberculosis could be spread in childbirth. Proponents of the bill claimed that allowing women to work would hurt the next generations. At the same time, women chose to work in polishing and grinding jobs at the typewriter factories and other metal industries. In this New Departure case, of the 120 polishers, fully one in four were women. The women were not paid as much as the men who got upwards of $18 per week, while the women earned between $9 and $12. Though the wages were substantially lower than the men’s, women were able to make more in this work than they made in traditional women’s work like garments where they earned about $6 per week. Employers argued that they were giving women a chance and the women workers seemed to be happy with their jobs. At the hearings, women from the typewriter and ball bearing factories testified to their fitness and their satisfaction at metal polishing and grinding. Women Polishers show their patriotism at the New Departure Manufacturing Company in Elmwood during World War I. Their main product was ball bearings. During the war, one in four of polishers were women. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. The New Departure machine tool factory opened in 1889 in Bristol to manufacture a doorbell that the owner Albert Rockwell invented. Nine years later, Rockwell patented a coaster brake for bicycles and then in 1901 he invented a new ball bearing for bikes, which became the ball bearing for the new automobile industry. New Departure bought land from the Whitlock Coil and Pipe Company, the first big manufacturer in Elmwood and built a plant in Elmwood that manufactured small ball bearings. Hugh Rockwell was the first manager who was succeeded in 1914 by Charles M. Gearing. In 1914, the company produced 5000 bearings a day in six different sizes. About 300 people worked at the plant. The company expanded until by 1917 they produced 8,000 bearings a day. The company bought a big parcel of land between Newington Road and the railroad tracks. The company developed the land into 150 homes. Management gave workers a break on the cost of the lots. By 1929, the lots were almost completely built up. While some workers went on strike for their rights in 1915, the company began to provide benefits beyond the workplace. New construction in 1919 doubled the floor capacity allowing for 12,000 bearings a day to be produced with 600 workers. When General Motors bought out New Departure in 1919, even more benefits flowed to the workers. Unlike the pattern of corporate takeovers today when it seems the bigger corporations take away benefits, General Motors expanded benefits for the New Departure workers. Those who worked in the 1920s got a savings and investment plan, group insurance which included sick benefit provisions. Their wages gave them the ability to buy their own homes, “enjoying more of the comforts of life than would otherwise have been his.” Industrialization helped many Elmwood citizens find their way to the American dream in the suburbs. What started with labor unrest and strikes, smoothed itself out as employers found the benefits of good working conditions and benefits for their workers. "],

For 65 years, the town meeting election of three selectmen and appointments to numerous boards seemed to serve the town well. But, as the population tripled from about 3,000 in 1900 to about 9,000 in 1920, the town meeting became unwieldy. There were no auditoriums big enough for the meetings and with the added services provided by the town, government had grown into something more than volunteers could handle. By 1917, the state passed an ordinance allowing the town of West Hartford to move to a town manager system of government which seemed like it would be more responsive to the town’s needs. In 1919, the town adopted the council-manager form of government which put the power to run the town in a Town Manager, and the power to make policy in the hands of a 15 member Town Council. West Hartford was the first town in Connecticut to adopt this form of government. The Town Council hired Benjamin Miller as our first Town Manager in 1919. He grew up in Avon, and took a two years’ business course at the New Britain Seminary. He served in Avon as selectman, founder of the Avon Library, chair of the school board, Judge of Probate and Democratic Representative to the General Assembly. During World War I, he was chair of the Draft Board for the Farmington Valley including West Hartford. When he became Town Manager, the three main issues facing the town were construction, maintaining and paving roads, zoning and running and building schools. The first charter called for the Town Council to appoint the Town Manager, Town Treasurer, Tax Collector, Controller, Town Engineer, Building Inspector, Town Auditors and Constables. They also had the power to appoint commissions and commissioners. Under Miller, in 1923, the town established the first comprehensive zoning ordinance to regulate land use in Connecticut and a Town Planning and Zoning Commission. The town hired its first paid police chief in 1923. In 1925, candidates for Town Council ran as members of a party, rather than as non-partisan candidates. The grand list grew from $19 million to $65 million. In 1929, the first woman, Grace Honiss, a vice president of the League of Women Voters became the first woman elected to the Town Council. And the town built Plant Junior High (1922), Talcott Junior High (1922), Hall High (1924), Beach Park School (1926), Smith School (1926), Elmwood School (1928), added onto Charter Oak School (1930), and Sedgwick School (1931). But all was not well with Miller’s administration. He was a Democrat and Republicans dominated the Council throughout the 1920s. It was unclear where power lay –- with the Town Manager or with Commissioners. Commissioners felt they had the right to appoint people to paid positions like Town Engineer and Building Inspector, and seemed to have used these positions as patronage. The Town Manager believed he should have the power to appoint the paid positions by merit, but this power seemed to have been taken away from him by the early 1930s. He resigned in 1933, under stress. When Miller left in 1933, he sued the town for back pay from his original contract made in 1919. He started at $4,000 per year and his salary increased to $4,800. However, once the depression hit, Miller’s pay was cut from a high of $4,800 to $4,400, ostensibly due to the financial problems associated with the Depression. But, Miller also left amid tension over loss of power in his job and the rise in the power of the town commissions headed by Town Council Members. He also left as the Great Depression deepened and the town pushed to have its employees take pay cuts. Within 15 years, the government charter already needed reform. By 1930, the population rose to almost 25,000 and the system of government had not fulfilled its original promise. In February, 1934, the Town Council hired a professor from Bowdoin College to study the way the town government worked, with an eye on proposing a more “businesslike plan of government.” The first report to the Town Council on the new plan for government claimed that by 1933, the town manager position had sunk to “innocuous desuetude,” meaning “disuse.” Apparently, Miller had fallen out of favor and spent little time at his job as his power got siphoned away by Town Council members, some of whom served as Commissioners. After he left, he sued the town for back pay. By September 1933, the Town Engineer who had been appointed by the Republican controlled Engineering Commission, Rodney Loomis, was running the town as the Town Manager. He retained both posts until he was finally made the official Town Manager. New Town Manager Rodney Loomis’ salary had soared to $7,500 by 1935. Loomis took much of the power away from the commissions by also serving as Director of Public Works, Director of the Police and Fire departments and the head of the Tax Department. In 1934, the 10 Republicans and 5 Democrats on the council agreed to this shift in power, believing Loomis had the best interests of the town in mind. Republican Max L. Goldenthal was President of the Council for the three years he served. While Loomis served, he convinced the Council to take advantage of building money provided through the federal government’s Work Progress Administration as part of the New Deal. The town built a town hall and library, financed about 45% by the federal government, on land that the First Church sold to the town to stay afloat during the Depression. The Democrats aligned themselves with the West Hartford Taxpayers Association, which submitted an alternative budget each year. The new 1935 charter reduced the Council to seven members, five elected by district and two at large. The charter established the position of Council President which in 1947 became “mayor.” The council seemed willing to give up the day to day running of the town to Loomis where the previous councils were not so willing with Miller. Loomis was known for being “gruff and business-like” and he ran the town efficiently. He stayed in his position for 22 years, until 1955, one year longer than Barry Feldman who just resigned after 21 years on the job. In 2006, West Hartford is only on its ninth town manager in 87 years. A council that agrees to be a policy making body, not an administrative body, and a non-partisan manager seem to be a successful combination. At this rate, new Town Manager Jim Francis should take us through to 2020! The Story of Susie Butler Andrews Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, December 2004 You’ll find the name Susie B. Andrews as the owner of land in West Hartford center in the 1909 Atlas of the City of Hartford and Town of West Hartford and the 1923 Sanborn Maps. Often women whose names appeared as property owners were actually holding land that their husbands controlled. But, in Andrews’ case, the Historical and Architectural Resource Survey of the Town of West Hartford (1982) by the Connecticut Historic Preservation Office tells us more. Susie B. Andrews, the study claims, “did a great deal to shape early West Hartford Center, building and managing commercial and residential properties.” How did she help shape the center as it moved from residential to commercial? According to her grandson, C. Allan Borchert, Susie grew up on the northeast corner of Main Street and Farmington Avenue. Her house was torn down to build the West Hartford Trust Company (now Bank of America). When she married Myron Andrews, a banker at the Colonial Bank in Hartford, she moved to 12 North Main Street. She was a shrewd business woman, who, Borchert recalled, was a tough negotiator. He remembered his grandfather in the early 1930s bemoaning her death in 1930 while he worked on his dairy farm. “If only Susie were here,” his grandfather said. The first residential development in the town center came when Frederick Rockwell bought and subdivided the King family farmland southeast of the center in 1896. Rockwell laid out parcels on Burr Street and had a grand plan for Boulevard which came to fruition between Memorial Drive and South Main Street. The houses in this subdivision were built between 1900 and the mid 1920s. The second residential development, northwest of the center was named West Hartford Heights. Developers subdivided this land around 1900, and the lots sold, but houses were not built until after 1914 when amenities like paved streets, electricity, and water were available. Susie Andrews laid out Dale Road in 1912 and subdivided the property. The development of West Hartford Center and the suburbanization of the town coincided with the improvement of transportation to West Hartford. In 1889, horse railway tracks were laid down Farmington Avenue and by 1894, the trolley was electrified. Those who worked in downtown Hartford had a regular, dependable transportation to and from Hartford, making the farm town more desirable as a residence. Susie B. Andrews had designs on the center. When the population grew from about 3,000 in 1900 to 33,000 by 1940, the retail needs of the town grew as well. Andrews owned land on the north side of Farmington Avenue, west of Main Street and on North Main Street. Even before West Hartford’s zoning laws went into effect, Andrews knew that it was a good idea to separate residential and commercial. One of Andrews’ residential development properties still stands at 9 Dale Road. This was one of the first houses built on Dale Street and is a beauty salon today. She also rehabilitated the building at 10 Dale Road which was probably an original barn to her childhood home on Farmington Avenue. To make way for the commercial development, Andrews moved several houses from Farmington Avenue to Whitman Street. The house at 30-32 Whitman Avenue was moved in 1912 when Andrews laid out Dale Road. Frederick Brace’s house originally stood on Farmington Avenue on the east side of the present Dale Road. Around 1850, he set up the first omnibus route between West Hartford and Hartford allowing town residents to commute to Hartford. It operated until the horse railway took over in 1889. This building is thought to have been the Old Academy Building on South Main Street until about 1840 when it was moved to Brace’s property on Farmington Avenue and then moved again to Whitman Avenue. Susie Andrews moved the colonial revival house built in 1912 which now stands on 75 Brace Road. Most houses along Brace were not built for at least another 10 years when amenities like piped water became available. This house was moved to its location from the corner of Farmington and Dale Street in the 1930s to make room for a commercial building. Myron and Susie Andrews’ son M. Morris Andrews built, owned and lived in this house which was just north of Farmington Avenue and Main Street. This house is identical to the one at 1022 Farmington Avenue. The colonial revival house, built in 1912, was moved from Farmington Avenue and Dale Street to 75 Brace Road in the 1930s to make room for commercial development. It was sold in 1970 by Butler Realty and is now a commercial property. Source: Town of West Hartford, CT Vision Government Solutions, parcel photos. It seemed that Susie got the area ready for commercial development. But the Depression hit and then she died in 1930 of tuberculosis. At that time, her business became the Andrews Corporation with each of her four children owning an equal share. Borchert remembers the family having lots of investments in land and property, but having very little money. When Borchert’s father died in the early 1930s, he and his mother and sister moved in with his grandfather at 10 North Main. He remembers his grandfather owning a dairy farm which he sold to A.C. Peterson’s farm in Bloomfield in the early 1930s. When his grandfather died, his mother took in boarders to survive. The commercial building at 984-992 Farmington Avenue (In 2004, housing Chico’s, the Elbow Room, and eight other stores) was built in 1935 by the Andrews Corporation, inheritors of the property of Susie B. Andrews. The commercial buildings like these with storefronts for about ten shops were just starting to come into existence and were just beginning to be known as malls. The 10-12 North Main Street building, now housing Sally and Bob’s, and the YMCA offices, was built in 1938 and was one of the first large office and commercial buildings in the center. It has details from the Colonial Revival style of architecture, and in that way, matches what was then the West Hartford Bank &amp; Trust building from 1926 and the government buildings including the Noah Webster Library, the Town Hall and Hall High School. It was probably built by Susie and Myron Andrew’s son Morris. This building was built on the site of Susie B. and Morris Andrews’ residence. By this time, Borchert and his mother had moved to another one of the residential properties the family owned, first at 44 Whitman Avenue and then at 32 Grennan Road The commercial building at 994-1000 Farmington Avenue, built in 1938, was also part of the Andrews retail empire. The Butler Building, named after Susie’s family name (the B stands for Butler) was built on the site of Susie Butler’s childhood home. This commercial building, influenced by the Colonial revival style, has much more architectural detail than the one to its east. Susie’s son Morris probably built the Butler Building as well. Susie B. Andrews was indeed a businesswoman. According to her grandson, she was also a woman of many talents. She was an excellent artist, painting scenes from her travels to Maine, Bermuda and some from the local scenery. She never sold any of her artwork, but each of her children has many of her paintings, It is surprising that there was so much development, both residential and commercial, in West Hartford in the 1930s, during the Great Depression. Susie Andrews was instrumental in setting the path for this development. Andrews’ management of land in the first three decades of the 20th century helped to shape both residential and commercial development in the center. These commercial buildings have stood the test of time. Andrews’ attempt to separate commercial and residential properties has held to a great extent as neighbors fight the encroachment of businesses in their neighborhoods. Ironically, Dale Road, Susie’s first real residential neighborhood is almost all commercial today. A Trip Back in Time to Westmoor Farm Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, January 2006 In 1925, Major A. Raymond Ellis bought 46 acres of land from Frank R. Scott on Flagg Road. He remodeled the barn, house and cottage to accommodate his pack of hounds to lead fox hunts at what he named Westmoor Farm. I usually think of West Hartford in 1930 as a developed suburb, but with a population of about 25,000, the town still retained some of its rural character. The new suburban residential development was predominantly on the east side along Farmington Avenue near Hartford and along North and South Main near the center. West of Main Street from Albany Avenue to New Britain Avenue still remained pasture and cropland. The land that the Major bought was originally the property of one of the earliest settlers in town, Thomas Merrill. Born in 1714, Merrill sold the farmland to Abijah Flagg in 1786. The land remained in the Flagg family for about 140 years; the last Flagg to own the property, Willis operated a dairy farm with 30 cows until about 1915. He grew vegetables as well and sold them at a stand he owned in nearby Bishop’s Corner. In 1922 he sold the land to Frank Scott and in 1925 Raymond Ellis bought the property. Ellis was an architect by profession. He moved to the United States from Nova Scotia in the late 1890s and then moved to Hartford in 1908 after finishing architectural school at MIT. When he bought Flagg’s land and buildings he remodeled them to accommodate riding horses as well as his pack of dogs. Ellis served in the cavalry in World War I. He helped with the reconstruction work in France in 1918 and 1919, using his skills as an architect. In 1922, just before he bought Westmoor, Ellis was named architectural editor of Women’s Home Companion magazine. By 1929, over 650 houses of Ellis’ design had been built, in part because of his connection to the magazine. He designed the Park River Bridge, the main building of the Hartford Hospital, the Connecticut Institute for the Blind, and the Isolation hospital at the McCook Memorial Hospital in Hartford. At Westmoor, Major Ellis built a riding and jumping course. He also created what he named the “Westmoor Farms Polo Club” in a cleared field on his property. Those who had played polo at the Hartford Golf Club when it was in Hartford had been looking for a place to play since the Club moved to West Hartford around the turn of the century. Ellis developed a fox hunt team and fox hunt. To lead a fox hunt, one needs open fields, water, and pastures for galloping horses that follow the pack of hounds. He had a pack of dogs trained and run by a man he hired. The fox hunts at Westmoor were done by “drag”: a set fox skin was dragged cross-country to leave a scent trail for the hounds. His hunt was cited in a book by A. Henry Higginson and in an English book called Bailey’s Hunting Directory from 1926 to 1930. Ellis held two horse shows on his property to entertain those in the neighborhood and make them more friendly to the idea of the hunt. The drag hounds went out three days a week from the middle of March to the middle of May and from the middle of September until snow and ice made the area unrideable. At that time, there were only a few neighbors to win over. Charles Allen Hunter (1874-1961) bought the land from Hartford Connecticut Trust in 1939 after the bank foreclosed on Ellis in the depths of the Depression. Hunter began to use it for a summer home starting in 1939, the year of his retirement. Hunter had been Vice President at Connecticut Bank and Trust when he retired after 45 years at age 65. Hunter hired a German immigrant horseman named William Wouters. From 1939 to the late 1960s, Wouters ran his business of breaking horses from Hunter’s stables in return for taking care of Mr. Hunter’s gelding. Wouters lived in a two bedroom apartment above the tack room in the stables. In 1984, at age 91, Wouters still lived in the stable. Wouters took care of the horses of wealthy girls attending Ethel Walker School and jeweler Bill Savitt who liked to ride. Wouters’ first worked at the Westmoor Farms Polo Club owned by architect and retired cavalry officer Major Ellis. Wouters transported horses for club members and saved enough money to buy a horse and wagon to carry building materials. In the early 1920s, Wouters opened his own boarding stables on Albany Avenue at Bishops Corner. When Hunter moved out to Westmoor in 1939, he convinced Wouters to come back to keep his business and take care of Hunter’s horses. Wouters expanded his business to board race horses from Narragansett, RI and Lincoln and Suffolk Downs in Boston. He exercised the animals at Westmoor before racing season began again in the spring. In 1961, Hunter died. In his will, he left 56 acres to the town of West Hartford along with a large house, servants quarters, a large barn, stable, several smaller buildings, pasture, brook and pond. He was married to Leila Clark Hunter who according to his will could continue to use the property until her death. When she died in January 1973, the town had to decide what to do with the property. By 1973, the neighborhood surrounding Westmoor Farms had changed considerably. Houses on Blue Ridge started to be built in the late 1930s through the 1950s. On Flagg Road, at least ten homes were built between 1956 and 1957. The suburban town had grown to a population of 62,382 by 1960. Neighbors had opinions about what should happen to the property. In February 1974, the Conservation Commission in West Hartford recommended that eight acres of the land be used for an equestrian center for riding instruction and boarding horses. The indoor equestrian ring was to be about the size of the Veterans Memorial Ice Skating Rink, 85 by 185 feet on the southwest corner of the property out of sight of Flagg Road. They would build six paddocks and add some riding trails with his bequest. This they thought could provide a revenue stream for the town. Besides the equestrian ring, the town planned to add a parking lot for about 70 cars, picnic facilities near the parking area with playground equipment, public bathrooms, a barnyard zoo, and a boardwalk and wood chip and gravel trails through the Hunter property. Hunter’s estate not only left the land, but also a sizable sum of $2.3 million to be used for maintenance of the park. The town received one-half the income from this trust, of about $130,000 per year. The reality of 2005 shows us that the park was much less developed in the final analysis. Neighbors on Flagg Road vehemently fought the development, and the park stayed in a fairly natural state. The idea of the equestrian ring, which was truly an extension of what Wouters had been doing for about 30 years lasted but a few months before the neighbors had convinced the town that this was not in their best interests. Today, the vestiges of horses on the farm are few, but for a developed inner ring suburb, Westmoor Park still gives a sense of those rural days less than a century ago, when most residents were farmers and there was enough open land for a fox hunt. Read more about the fox hunt in a pamphlet written by Robert Anderson called Westmoor Hunt, 1925-30 found at the Noah Webster House. A folder in the WHPL vertical file on Westmoor Park tells the history of the park in newspaper articles. The Life and times of Edna Purtell Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, February 2007 I first encountered Edna Purtell while writing my master’s thesis on the Connecticut Woman’s Suffrage Movement. She was known for her abilities as a speaker. In an interview, she claimed that she “never wrote any of her speeches on paper, but I could consistently captivate audiences.” When I wrote last month’s West Hartford Life article on William Purtell, a Republican Senator from West Hartford, I realized that the two were brother and sister and yet they seemed to have diametrically opposed political views. Edna Purtell (1899-1985) was born on Albany Avenue in Hartford, the daughter of a cigar maker. Her father was a member of Samuel Gomper’s Cigarmakers Union. Her father, apprenticed at the age of nine, became a leader in the Hartford union. In 1911, he fought to allow a black man into the union because he knew that blacks, just like the whites, paid the same 5¢ for a loaf of bread. Purtell’s mother was a cigar stripper who belonged to the union as well. Edna Purtell graduated from the night high school. She held jobs as a babysitter, clerk at the five and ten, and as a tobacco stripper at Doyle’s Tobacco Shop. At 16, she was elected secretary of the cigar strippers’ union. By age 18 she went to work at Travelers Insurance Company in the filing department. Edna’s brother William was two years older than she. While Edna identified with the working class, her brother became an entrepreneur. In her spare time, Purtell volunteered in the woman’s suffrage movement, handing out leaflets in downtown Hartford and going door to door to get signatures on petitions. A chance encounter in 1918 in front the of Brown Thompson Department store between Purtell and Katharine Hepburn (the actress’s mother), the head of the Connecticut Women’s Party led to Purtell taking the train to Washington to demonstrate. There she was arrested in front of Woodrow Wilson’s White House and fined. Purtell represented working class women, and took the train to D.C. and got arrested four separate times and was finally thrown in jail for six days and there she went on a hunger strike all in the name of woman’s suffrage. She was also arrested for climbing Lafayette’s statue and proclaiming “Lafayette, we are here.” Lafayette, a French general during the American Revolution, was a champion of liberty. The police broke two of Purtell’s fingers snatching her suffrage sash while arresting her. When she returned to work after protesting, Travelers President Batterson called her down to his office.He said, “You know, Miss Purtell, you’re liked very well here, but we don’t want you to be talking about suffrage and so forth.” She replied, “Mr. Batterson, during work hours I’ll take care of my job. But once I get in that elevator, what I talk about is my business, not yours. And on our coffee break, that’s our coffee break, and I’ll talk about anything I want.” Batterson never said another word to her and Purtell’s characteristic honesty prevailed. Purtell’s suffragist activity with the Connecticut Woman’s Party was more radical than the work of Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association. When women won suffrage in 1920, the more conservative women from the CWSA formed the League of Women Voters. Instead, Purtell became one of the first members and a leader in the State Federation of Democratic Women’s Clubs. Even into the 1970s, when the League became a more progressive group, she never joined. Purtell served on many committees and was often the keynote speaker for these groups. In 1924 she supported Progressive Robert LaFollette for President because he supported the initiative, the referendum and the recall. She supported the movement to free Ireland from British rule. In 1928, she helped organize a “Women for Al Smith” committee to support the Democrat running for President. In 1930, Purtell was elected Parliamentarian of the Hartford Women’s Democratic Club. She served on the legislative committee which followed bills in the state legislature. She lobbied for jury service for women, old age pensions, and improving the status of women in factories. In March 1933, at a meeting of the Connecticut Women Democrats, Purtell reported on the conditions of jails for women in Hartford County. She said the cells were unsanitary and the women did not have enough freedom. In 1936, she was an alternate to the national Democratic Convention which nominated FDR for a second term. Her interests were wide-ranging. In May 1934, Purtell was part of a group which sponsored a symposium on Nazi book burning. She joined the pastor of the Center Church, the head of the Seminary, two rabbis and Annie Fisher, the Superintendent of one of the Hartford school districts, to raise awareness of the public. While Purtell immersed herself in Democratic politics, her brother opened a factory called Holo-Chrome and by World War II he had bought Billings and Spencer in West Hartford. Then he began to dabble in politics himself. Hartford Courant political writer Jack Zaiman claimed he too, was a great speaker, but his view of the role of government differed from his sister. He thought that social problems should be solved through private initiative first and only then through government action. His sister may have agreed with him about labor issues for men who tended to have strong unions, but she believed strongly that the government needed to regulate businesses. After several years at Travelers, Edna Purtell got a job as an investigator for the Connecticut State Labor Department. She gave a speech at a rally to support a state pension plan. In 1936, she exposed a case where a dressmaking shop in a Hartford department store made women work more than a nine hour day. She worked for the department for 14 years and was a pioneer for protective labor legislation, particularly for children employed in the state tobacco fields. She wrote a pamphlet for the Labor Department in the 1940s on children in the tobacco industry. She led the fight to end child labor in Connecticut and in 1946 outlined the problems of child labor in a news article. There was no minimum age for agricultural workers and the children worked as many as ten hours per day. In 1948, the Connecticut Democratic Women’s Convention asked Purtell to be their keynote speaker. It was thought that she might have a place on the state ticket for elective office. At that time she and the Democratic women called for an end to the regressive sales tax and for a progressive income tax. However, she never ran for political office. Senate nominee Thomas Dodd, a Democrat, named her to head his office on women’s concerns in 1956. In that role, she worked for the man who ran against her brother. The family gathered to support Edna Purtell when she won an award commemorating her life of public service on behalf of women. Source: Purtell family. After she retired from the state in 1956, she remained politically active. Governor Dempsey named Purtell to Connecticut’s Permanent Commission on the Status of Women in 1966. When the Equal Rights Amendment was revived in 1970, Purtell was one of the first to testify before the legislature’s Human Rights and Opportunities subcommittee headed by Gloria Shafer (who later became Connecticut’s third female Secretary of State). Purtell defined herself as “an old style militant suffragist” claiming that even after women got the right to vote, they “were still not persons.” In 1975, at age 76, Purtell was still active politically. She published a letter to the editor supporting a state income tax and supporting Homer Babbidge’s run for Governor. At that time she served on the legislative committee of West Hartford’s North End Senior Center, continuing to monitor and lobby for legislative measures. Purtell lived more than 40 years in West Hartford, well into her 80s. While her brother’s political career took him to Washington, it lasted only six years in the U.S. Senate. Edna continued her role as an activist throughout her life, speaking for the rights of those who had the smallest voice. Amateur Radio in West Hartford Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, August 2010 Town Councilman Steve Adler and Dr. Rick Liftig are two of the more than 175 ham radio operators who live in West Hartford. In a day of instant communication through the internet and cell phone, these amateur operators seem something of an anomaly. In June 2010, Mayor Scott Slifka presented a proclamation to representatives of the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) in recognition of West Hartford’s tie to the growth and support of this organization as he recognized amateur radio’s deep roots in West Hartford. Their communication system serves as a community service in times of disaster as well as a hobby, which three million people enjoy worldwide. Different from the telegraph, which sent a Morse Code message by impulses over a wire, amateur radio operators send messages over the air waves. The U.S Government through the Commerce Department began licensing operators in 1912. Hartford’s Hiram Percy Maxim founded the Amateur Radio Relay League in 1914 when he wanted to send a message from Hartford to Springfield and did not have a strong enough signal to do so. He contacted a relay in Windsor Locks and his Morse Code message made it to its intended receiver. Maxim, who invented the Maxim Silencer for guns (1909), and the car muffler, was a radio enthusiast who helped to develop a network of amateur radio operators. In 1914, he was a member of the Hartford Radio Club, but realized there would be an advantage to a wider network of hams. By September 1914, their network grew to over 230 stations. Just 15 months later, there were 600 stations and the ARRL published its first bulletin QST (meaning Calling all Radio Amateurs) to help coordinate the actions of the operators. When the United States joined the Great War in 1917, the Department of Commerce sent a letter to all amateurs ordering them off the air. During the war, the ARRL coordinated the recruitment of operators into the armed services where they continued to hone their skills for the public good. In 1918, at the war’s end, the U.S. Government tried to control the transmission of messages under the Department of the Navy, but the ARRL lobbied Congress to allow individuals to control their transmissions and they quashed several bills in Congress allowing them to do so. The ARRL under Maxim’s watch, provided technical advice and assistance to amateur radio enthusiasts, and regulated them before the Federal Communication Commission was founded in 1934. With Maxim the first ARRL headquarters inhabited “a couple of shabby rooms” on Main Street in downtown Hartford. In 1925 the staff of 18 moved to 1711 Park Street. West Hartford’s role really began in 1931, when the ARRL built its headquarters at 38 LaSalle Road, where Coldwell Banker was in 2010. This new location housed the League in a two-story building. They had a $200,000 budget and 28 full time employees. Many amateur radio geeks moved to town who worked at ARRL headquarters. They found housing in the old Selden Hill farmhouse on top of Buena Vista. Rilla and Henry Selden lived in the house up on the bluff and their seven children had grown and moved away. Mrs. Selden posted “Rooms for Tourists” sign down on Farmington Avenue near the Reservoir. Two men from the ARRL station looked for a place to live, they found, not only a “home,” but also a great radio location where they could experiment. Associate Editor Ross Hull, an Australian, and Managing Editor Clark Rodimon of QST were some of the first boarders to move in. Rodimon invented the first two-way five-meter contact between Hartford and Boston –- over 100 miles in 1934 from Selden Hill. Hull was known worldwide for his pioneering work in developing the VHF and UHF spectrum for the 56, 112 and 224 MHz amateur bands. According to Rilla Selden, “they strung up a big contraption among the trees. Then Ross talked to a half a dozen fellows in Boston and none of them would believe he was in Hartford.” Hull had strung a high gain beam array in the trees. The amateur radio operators in Boston spent the next half hour “discussing that bootlegger who claims to be in Hartford.” They could not believe that the signal could be sent 100 miles. Hull proved that radio beams could go beyond the horizon and “bend” to the curvature of the earth. The various boarders continued to experiment on Selden Hill. They scaled the old slate roof to put up transmission lines and they built sky-wires for fun on a Saturday afternoon. Even in 1944, according to an article “The Legend of Selden Hill,” in QST, remains of these structures still existed. These amateurs were not just satisfied with experimenting with words over the airwaves. They built radio controlled gliders and airplanes. Selden Hill’s steep slope provided a great spot to use as a launch pad. One of these gliders, with a wingspan of 16 feet is at the ARRL station in Newington today. In the early 1930s, Ross Hull experimented with television at Selden Hill. He wanted to “reduce to amateur practice” the complicated nature of sending pictures over the airwaves. He tried several television experiments in 1937 that debunked the professional opinions that the maximum range of television transmission was 30 to 40 miles. In fact, he successfully received NBC’s transmissions from the Empire State Building over 100 miles away in 1937. Hull criticized the professional television industry for their commercialism. Because the equipment was so much more expensive, amateurs had more difficulty experimenting. Hull moved to Bolton in 1938 where he accidentally contacted 6,000 volts while working on his experimental television receiver and died. According to present day amateur radio operator Rick Liftig “Virtually all of our modern communication techniques derived from these experiments.” Almost 70 years later, amateur radio operators continue to help the public by radioing in times of emergency during natural disasters. Their dedication to public service and their dedication to their hobby symbolize the community involvement that continues to make West Hartford such a vibrant town. Perhaps an historical marker on LaSalle would help keep this 20th century history alive! Dr. Caroline Hamilton Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, August 2012 Recently, the daughter of a good friend left for Thailand for a year’s service. Part adventurer, and part human rights activist, Katherine will be teaching English to Buddhist monks in Chang Mai, Thailand. The rise in interest in human rights issues, student exchanges, and college student travel around the globe, are all part of a 21st century global outlook. This generational shift, however, is far from new. Take a look at Caroline Hamilton. On September 12, 1944, Dr. Caroline Hamilton died at age 83. Her obituary stated that she was a native of West Hartford, a graduate of Smith College, and a graduate of the Women’s Medical College of the New York Infirmary for Women and Children. It went on to say that “From 1892 to her retirement in 1932, Dr. Hamilton was medical missionary at the Azariah Smith Memorial Hospital, Aintab, Turkey, in charge of medical services for Moslem women.” In 1930, William H. Hall, West Hartford’s retired Superintendent of Schools, devoted two pages in his book West Hartford to Dr. Hamilton. In his section entitled Biographical Notes, Hall wrote about four West Hartford families, and 24 individuals, two who were women. According to Hall, Hamilton was born to Benedict and Electa Hamilton at their home on the south side of Farmington Avenue just east of Trout Brook, on a 70 acre farm near the present site of Kingswood Oxford School. Hamilton went to the West Hartford High School after it was opened in 1872 on North Main Street as the second floor of the Center District School. She went on to graduate from Hartford High School in 1880 and then Smith College in 1885 at age 24. Hamilton graduated from the New York Women’s Medical College (1863-1918) in 1888. She enrolled in the school when the founder Dr. Clemence S. Lozier was still running the school. Founded in 1863 with seven women, by 1888, 219 women doctors moved into practices from Maine to California. She interned at the hospital for a year, and then got involved in “college settlement work” as a physician, just at the time that Jane Addams and Lillian Wald established Settlement Houses in Chicago and New York City. Wald and other settlement workers tried to ensure that all members of society, including women and children, immigrants and the poor, and people of all ethnicities and religious groups could realize the promise of American ideals of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” Hamilton also found time to teach in the Medical College where she got her degree and was a resident physician at the New York Infant Asylum which provided care for abandoned children. The Asylum also provided obstetrical care for unwed or indigent women. She did more graduate study in New York and in 1892, at age 31, the American Board of Missions appointed her to the hospital in Aintab, Turkey where she worked from 1892 to 1932. A Hartford Courant article from September 19, 1893 quoted an article in Harper’s Bazaar saying that the Ottoman Sultan had granted permission ”for a woman physician to engage in her profession within his domain.” Caroline Hamilton was sent at the expense of a “Boston lady” and she set up a hospital for women and children in Aintab. A memorial record for Hamilton from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in Aintab, Turkey tells of her work for 40 years (1892 - 1932). Hamilton saw over 1000 patients per year, focusing on women’s health. The memorial tells that she was aided by Elizabeth Trowbridge, her close friend who lived with her for over 39 years in Turkey, and then they “found a home together” in Holyoke, MA, when they returned. Source: Amerikan Bord Heyeti (American Board), Istanbul, “Memorial records for Caroline F. Hamilton.” Hamilton’s work took her beyond the walls of the hospital in Aintab to help heal the sick and needy people in all parts of the city, going to individual homes in some cases, exposing herself to great danger. She also worked for the mission church and school. She played the organ, taught Sunday School, and conducted services. Hamilton was in what we now know as Turkey during the Armenian genocide (1915-18). When Hamilton was in Aintab, she lived through three massacres, including one in which the perpetrators came to the gates of the hospital to destroy all the inmates. In 1915, the city of Aintab near the Syrian border had 40,000 Armenians who were Christians, and by 1922 there were only 3,000 remaining. The Turks forced the Armenians to march into the desert to the east, leaving them with no supplies and no protection. They took their belongings and some were put in concentration camps. Historians estimate that as many as one million Armenians died in the genocide and 500,000 left Turkey. In the middle of the genocide, in October 1917, a report from a returning missionary described Hamilton’s worth to the Turks. The Turks worried that she would leave when the United States entered the Great War. Though the U.S. never fought in Turkey, we allied with the Turk’s enemies. Hamilton was not in good health as she had contracted typhus in 1915 and never fully recovered. The other missionaries tried to get her to leave, but she pledged to stay until the war ended. Some city residents tried to get her to take on citizenship so that she would not be expelled from the country. Though she stayed, she was persecuted, having stones thrown at her when she visited patients and finally she took a soldier with her when she made home visits. Her hospital for women and children was transformed during the war into a military hospital with ties to the Red Cross. Hamilton preached Christianity to the wounded soldiers. At the same time, she had to listen to soldiers boast of their role in the genocide. Hamilton also cared for 12,000 refugee women and children. The missionary described Hamilton sewing a woman’s nose that had been almost cut off. The patient then went on to become one of the best workers in the hospital. On February 16, 1920, the New York Times reported that The American Committee for Relief in the Near East said that Americans had escaped from several towns where Armenians were being massacred. Armenians were destitute and many were sick and wounded. Hamilton evacuated from Aintab and was safely in Marash with 16 other missionary workers. In that same month, Hamilton came back to the US and spoke before the Smith College Club where she argued that the U.S. had to take action and move beyond its ignorance and indifference. She claimed that the U.S. was better suited than either the French or British to carry out this military action. President Woodrow Wilson tried to help sustain the Armenian state which was established in 1918. Opposition from the Republican Party and a lack of troops led to the Armenian state collapsing in November 1920. Hamilton left Turkey for 18 months from August 1920 to February 1922 when the Turkish government carried out more massacres against the Armenians and her hospital had to be abandoned. At that time, she went to Beirut where she ran an orphanage for 300 children. Throughout her 37 years abroad in Aintab, Turkey and in Lebanon, Hamilton remained a member of the First Congregational Church in West Hartford. She wrote letters to church members and received gifts of money and supplies at Christmas from the church’s Bible School. When she came back to the United States on furlough, she addressed missionary meetings, not just at the First Church, but at churches throughout the area. Hamilton’s work, which started more than 120 years ago brought one of the first woman physicians from the U.S. to a country where she witnessed mass murder. Her motivations, probably to live the life of an independent woman, and to play an important medical role in a place where she was “other” and could have more power, may not be too different from young people’s motivation for mission trips today. Hamilton’s Christian missionary zeal sets her in a different era, but her idea to use her expertise to help those in need still holds sway today. Superintendent Lloyd Bugbee Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, March 2010 West Hartford’s population growth between 1910 and 1920, led to an emergency situation in the schools, as buildings were not constructed fast enough to keep up with the growing student population. At the same time, the administration couldn’t keep track of its teachers. Superintendent William H. Hall led the school system through this growth (1897-1922), but when he retired in 1922, his successor Lloyd Bugbee, jumped into action. In 1922-3, Superintendent Bugbee asked the Connecticut State Board of Education to survey West Hartford’s schools. The 151-page survey provided Bugbee the outside pressure to accomplish much of what he may already have known needed to be done. As soon as the State Board published its survey, several towns asked for copies and the state department printed 350 copies for its own distribution. Lloyd Bugbee was hired in 1917 at age 27 as the principal of West Hartford’s high school. He grew up in Vermont, graduated from Dartmouth College, and then did graduate work at Columbia Teacher’s College. When Bugbee took over for the 74 year old Hall, it was truly a changing of the guard. Until 1917, William H. Hall served as both principal and superintendent and had no staff to support him. Between 1913 and 1922, high school enrollment jumped from 105 to 343. While the population grew about 84%, the high school enrollment grew over 300%. Under Hall, two new junior highs were built and construction began on the high school. Bugbee was known for both building the infrastructure and developing an innovative curriculum in West Hartford. Bugbee had to address the overcrowding in the elementary schools. With a school population that almost doubled from 1910 to 1920 to 1,769 pupils, Bugbee had to find places for the students to attend school. Ten classrooms were so crowded that they had to go on double sessions. Under his administration, 12 new schools opened. He added courses in the high school that included aeronautics, driver education, and nature study. And Columbia University’s Teachers’ College named the new elementary curriculum exemplary. The State Board of Education Survey, published in 1923, recommended improved supervision along with a building program which entailed spending about $100,000 over two years. The Survey called for hiring a supervisor for the elementary schools while Bugbee would supervise the junior and senior high schools. The Board of Education hired that person. The survey called for establishing special classes for adult education. And, as schools began to take on more responsibilities than just the 3 R’s, the survey recommended West Hartford hire a school physician, dental hygienist, and director of physical education right away. Bugbee used the report to act. In 1923, West Hartford began its adult education division by offering its first three classes at the Elmwood School. Also, Bugbee promoted the West Hartford public schools outside the town. He took on leadership roles in the region as well. In his second year as Superintendent, Bugbee chaired the fall meeting of the Connecticut State Teachers’ Association held at Hartford Public High School. West Hartford excelled in writing elementary school curriculum. By January 1926, Teachers College at Columbia University commended Superintendent Bugbee on the new elementary curriculum. Bugbee, his elementary school supervisor Ethel Merriman and a committee of teachers designed a course of study in history and geography judged to be one of the top 25 out of several hundred submitted to the college. West Hartford pioneered in foreign language instruction. In April 1926, Bugbee addressed a New York City conference of eastern junior high schools to describe West Hartford’s introduction of foreign languages in the eighth grade. Students spent one-semester learning word origins, six weeks of Latin, and five weeks of French, to learn the principles of words. The curriculum introduced all students to the study of language in an innovative way. Bugbee encouraged the implementation of exploratory courses for eighth graders. The Beach Park School also helped put West Hartford on the educational map. With five acres of land donated by T. Belknap Beach in 1925, the Beach Park School was the first in West Hartford to be built in a park-like setting. Beach wrote in the deed that no trees could be cut except for park purposes. The architecture of the building was more like a home than an institution. The colonial structure and color scheme for the three-classroom building, finished in 1926, were a departure for school buildings. A national education journal wrote an article about the school and educators visited from across the country. Bugbee’s idea was to develop a school with the “happy atmosphere and freedom which the preschool child enjoys at home. It is a place where children may live together working, playing and learning as they might do in a happy family.” The building enhanced the teachers’ abilities to reach these goals. In 1929, Bugbee wrote “This home-like and livable atmosphere is probably one of the most outstanding evidences of progressive education.” Teachers and administrators in Connecticut viewed Bugbee as a leader. He was a regular at the state teacher’s convention. In 1927, he was elected by 200 state delegates to represent Connecticut at the National Teacher’s convention in Minneapolis. The Hartford Courant praised Bugbee in 1929 for urging the town to buy school sites before the town was ready to build and before neighborhoods were built. Bugbee claimed this was a policy established by William H. Hall. In 1929, the town bought the site on Park Road on which Sedgwick School was built. It also bought two properties in the northern, undeveloped section of town. The Courant article claimed “Superintendent Bugbee is considered invaluable to the town by many officials because of his acute vision in school matters.” By 1930, in his ninth year as Superintendent, Bugbee’s reputation continued to grow. Franklin E. Pierce, state supervisor of secondary education commended Bugbee for following through with a ten-year survey following high school graduates. Pierce commended the survey for following not just students who went to college but also those who went straight into the workforce. Bugbee used the survey to ascertain what advantage students got from the West Hartford. While the Connecticut State Department’s Survey in 1923 was critical of the school system, Bugbee, at the young age of 32, used it to legitimize many of the changes he wanted to bring to the town. Bugbee’s leadership put the West Hartford schools in the vanguard in Connecticut and the nation. The League of Women Voters: Building Leaders in a Democracy Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, June 2002 West Hartford’s League of Women Voters, established in 1923, has been a vibrant community organization dedicated to building leadership and “a better informed, more intelligent electorate.” When the 19th Amendment enfranchised 20 million voters, the League was established to make sure these women were informed and politically active. The League, and outgrowth of the suffrage associations, exists on national, state and local levels. The League’s longevity and success is based on several factors. They have specific goals based on civic engagement in a democracy, they build a sense of community within the organization, and provide many different types of activities for members, taking advantage of their strengths and abilities. Women’s political roles expanded in the 1920s and the League reflected this. At the same time, many women held onto their traditional roles in society and in the organization. The West Hartford League formed in September 1923 (two years after the state and national Leagues), just three years after women won the right to vote. The leadership in the Connecticut Woman’s Suffrage Association and the Connecticut Women’s Party became the leaders in the League. In 1920, West Hartford’s 9,000 residents lived in a suburb. There were still farms in the north and south ends of town, but the percentage of people in town who worked in farming declined. Some residents worked in West Hartford factories like Spencer Turbine or Whitlock Coil and Pipe, while many of the new residents took the trolley to jobs in Hartford. The new houses built on farmland attracted middle class families, in which wives left the workplace upon marriage and often had time for and an interest in volunteer work. The League had a political mission to increase the number of citizens actively involved in our democracy. League member Charlotte Lundgaard led a drive to register more voters. Only 23% of the West Hartford electorate voted in 1922, and the League took it upon itself to register more voters. The League bought 1,100-penny postcards, at a cost of $11 and sent them to eligible voters. On registration day in 1923, they set up a tent in the center of town, provided babysitting, served coffee, and provided transportation. The drive netted 940 new voters, and in 1924 twice as many voters cast ballots as in any previous election. Charlotte Lundgaard won a $150 nationwide contest for her drive to get out the vote. Lundgaard wrote in her application for the national award that even if not a single voter had been registered, “the labor of that enterprise would have been worth it to ascertain what League “team power” was. Our organization worked as a man that day, with magnificent esprit de corps.” Lundgaard’s definition of success in this case was working like “a man,” despite the fact that all the work was done by women. In this sense, Lundgaard bought into the male idea of success, but did it all with women power. The League also studied political issues as part of their mission. In the 1920s and 1930s, the League sponsored “Citizenship Schools,” which organized speakers to talk about the problems of the day. Both men and women attended these “schools” and the League provided childcare for mothers with young children. In 1924, the League sponsored an exhibit entitled “The Fair Tariff.” In June 1925, they spent $1.85 on a Child Labor Study Guide from the national organization. They set up study committees about town government, education, and planning and zoning. These committees provided leadership roles for women who had for so long been kept out of the public sphere. The sense of community built by the League played a large role in the League’s success. Through the mid-1920s, many of the League meetings worked around an elegant tea. Attendees dressed in their best clothes including hats and white gloves. At first, luncheons were held in the Masonic Hall, but by the late 1920s, luncheon meetings were the West Hartford Country Club (today Buena Vista) and the Hartford Golf Club hosted the meetings. The Hospitality Chair was one of the most important women on the Board. These luncheon meetings catered to women who, though they did not work for wages, maintained a concern about the political world. This sense of community, fostered by these luncheons, gave the League staying power. League members also raised money. In the 1920s and 1930s, the League used rummage sales, bridge parties, tea dances, and yearly dues to raise money. Committees formed to organize each event. The League served as a training ground for women who got involved in politics. In 1929, Mrs. William Honiss, the Vice President of the League ran and won election as the first woman to the Town Council. In 1932, the school board appointed Mrs. Edward Lorenz as its first woman. The Board was appointed well into the 1950s. Louise Duffy was appointed to the school board in 1938. Before entering formal political office, all three women were longtime members of the League. This wide-ranging, bipartisan organization offered numerous opportunities for women to get involved in the political world. Though many historians see the 1920s as a time of frivolity and flappers, characterized as the “Roaring Twenties,” many women continued to pursue the reforms that had started in the Progressive Era before World War I. Anne O’Hare McCormick, the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize in journalism, for her work as a foreign correspondent for the New York Times, was the inspiration for a pen and ink drawing of a woman with a broom on the front cover of the 1945-6 West Hartford League of Women Voters pamphlet. The League, and McCormick believed that women should find careers and not be intimidated by men. They also believed women would help clean up politics. In 1953, the League continued to push for women’s representation in local government. League President Ruth B. Gibson advocated for a woman to be appointed to the Board of Education.

In this organization, women educated themselves about political issues, learned from speakers at meetings, and studied national and local political issues. They enjoyed the social activities like tea dances and fancy luncheons at the country club and used them to build support and community. For others, organizing fundraisers gave them a means to develop a sense of worth and a sense of community. For still others, the experience with the League led them into the male dominated world of politics. League women went with a broom in their hands to clean up abuses of power as they saw them, while they tried to broaden the electorate and wholeheartedly support democracy. Ruth Dadourian: A Stalwart for Justice June 2018 Connecticut is often seen as the “land of steady habits,” with a conservative base that did not take to political change very readily. This held true for the Connecticut state legislature’s lack of ability to pass the woman’s suffrage amendment until after it became a federal amendment in 1920. But in other ways, women like West Hartford’s Ruth Dadourian (1892-1983) led the way for rights for women and justice for many others. Ruth and her husband Haroutune lived much of their adult life in Hartford. In 1950, after Prof. Dadourian retired from Trinity College, they built a house on the Old Mill Pond north of the American School for the Deaf, and moved to 177 North Main Street, West Hartford to live out their retirement years. Ruth McIntire was born in Italy in the late 1890s, and by time she graduated from Radcliffe in 1912, she was an accomplished linguist knowing Italian, Russian and French. She took part in her first woman’s suffrage demonstration when she was a student at Radcliffe College. There she met her husband, H.H. Dadourian who became a math professor at Trinity College in the late 1910s. Ruth Dadourian’s first job was as a publicist for the National Child Labor Committee. In 1918, Dadourian wrote a pamphlet for the National Child Labor Commission decrying child labor. She found children as young as five working in the beet fields. Dadourian’s main academic interests were in child welfare and labor, public health education and labor laws. When she first arrived in Hartford, she didn’t know many people but brought with her a desire to work for justice. While shopping downtown, she discovered the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association headquarters. She walked in and was “greeted with open arms,” a young woman interested in suffrage. She said, before she knew it, she was on the board of the organization. Dadourian actively participated in the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association. When the Connecticut Woman’s Party, led by Katharine Houghton Hepburn, split off from the group in 1917, there was not the same rancor between the two groups as existed on the national level. In fact, Dadourian argued that “the Woman’s Party was really the spearhead and then we (CWSA) could follow through… The more outrageous they were, the better off we were.” When women won the right to vote, Dadourian knew the battle for women’s rights was not over. She knew that the campaign had not just been to win the vote, but women had to continue to educate both suffragists and their opponents, and make policy makers know women would actually participate in political matters. In 1920, she said, “Even if we wanted to, could we possible escape the responsibility of victory?” On March 21, 1921, Dadourian appeared at a hearing for House Bill No. 722, providing for the extension of the personal tax to women. Assessing this $2 tax collected each year by each municipality would show that women had “equal franchise rights” with men. If men failed to pay, they were imprisoned. Male legislators seemed to think it would not be the right thing to imprison women so were hesitant to pass the bill. Dadourian, the legislative secretary of the Connecticut League of Women Voters, favored extending the personal tax to women, but suggested exemptions, possibly in the case of mothers, to demonstrate that women were, in fact, equal. In 1923, Ruth Dadourian was instrumental in starting the West Hartford League of Women Voters. She served as the director of the state league from 1926 and then became its president and lobbyist from 1934 to 1935. On March 19, 1927, Dadourian wrote a letter to the editor of the Hartford Courant in support of women serving on juries. She argued that hundreds of women from all over the state supported this bill and packed the hearing. The lobbying effort was thorough. Urban and rural women testified from every part of Connecticut. Women who served on juries from surrounding states testified as did judges, lawyers, and prosecuting attorneys. Dadourian wondered if those against the bill believed that Connecticut women were “inferior in intelligence and ability to women in the twenty-one states where they are now serving.” There were those who believed that the state should hold a referendum to poll women on whether they wanted to serve on juries because the opposition claimed they did not. Dadourian argued “our representatives are elected to use their best judgment in enacting wise legislation for the State.” In 1927, Connecticut had 15 women in the legislature, more than in any other state and women had every other legal right men had. Dadourian and her husband also weighed in on international affairs. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the United States did not recognize the new revolutionary government. In 1930, she and her husband, a native of Armenia and fluent in Turkish, Armenian, Russian and French took a seven month study tour to Europe. When they returned, the Dadourians advocated for diplomatic and commercial recognition of the Soviet government, which finally came in 1933. They praised the Soviet people for their “enthusiasm and willing sacrifice… in their efforts to attain the Communist ideals.” Mrs. Dadourian argued that before the war, two-thirds of the Russian population were illiterate. Just 13 years later in 1930, only one-third was illiterate. The government built hospitals and nurseries for women workers. The Dadourians saw that the Russian Soviet people sacrificed greatly for the changes made by the Communist government. The institutional changes that impressed the Dadourians the most were communal apartments with communal kitchens to free thousands of women from kitchen drudgery; parks for children, and a penal system, which the Dadourians believed did not use retribution. One wonders if they felt the effects of the McCarthy questioning 20 years later. During the New Deal, Ruth was supervisor of the Division of Women’s and Professional Projects of the Works Progress Administration in Connecticut. During Governor Wilbur Cross’s tenure, the Connecticut League of Women Voters presented the state with a memorial tablet commemorating 31 women who according to Dadourian, “built up public opinion which resulted in women winning the franchise.” Isabella Beecher Hooker, a nine-year-old great-granddaughter of Isabella Beecher Hooker unveiled the tablet. You can still find it in the south corridor of the Capitol. In 1935, Dadourian chaired the Connecticut Committee for Ratification of the Child Labor Amendment. (She must have known Louise Duffy who supported it as well.) Dadourian wanted the National Recovery Administration Codes, which banned child labor in many occupations, and was set to expire in 1935, to continue through a constitutional amendment. This law was never passed. In 1934, both Ruth and her husband Haroutune appeared in a publication called The Red Network: A “Who’s Who” and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots. In this book she and her husband were listed under a group called “communist recommended authors,” a group officially endorsed by the Soviet Union Review, an organ of the Soviet government in Washington D.C. The pamphlet publicized their leftist leanings, probably based on their glowing reports of the Soviet Union after their travels. In 1941, Governor Robert Hurley (a West Hartford resident) appointed Dadourian to the Board of Trustees of the University of Connecticut. Just two months later she was appointed field representative to assist the chair of the woman’s divisions of local defense councils and volunteer offices in planning and carrying out their activities. She served as chair of the statewide conference for women in defense. Bob Stewart, retired Trinity professor of mathematics, remembered Ruth Dadourian after she had a stroke. She invited guests over for dinner. When it was time for dinner, it took Dadourian about ten minutes to make her way from the living room to the dining room, but according to Stewart, everyone in the room knew enough not to ask her if she needed help. She was very strong willed and had few soft edges, remembered Stewart. But people enjoyed being in her presence. They knew what she stood for and they wanted her on their side. Louise Day Duffy June 2018 If you enter Duffy Elementary School on any morning, you will hear the Duffy “pledge” over the loudspeaker: As Duffy citizens, we show respect, demonstrate compassion, and take responsibility for our learning and our actions. That is a motto that Louise Day Duffy could embrace. Her matronly portrait that hangs in the hallway of Duffy Elementary School belies the active life she led as an advocate for students, the poor, women, and those without a voice. In 1949 when the Board of Education voted to name an elementary school after Duffy they showed their support for these moral ideals and her belief in public service. Louise Day Duffy (1885-1973) joined many politically active women in West Hartford by breaking the mold about what was acceptable for women in the first half of the 20th century. Her leadership in our town is remarkable. When Louise Day was 11, her parents moved from Avon with their seven children to Raymond Road; her father helped develop Frederick Rockwell’s Boulevard with the median down the middle of the road between Trout Brook and South Main Street. Her father’s contracting business, P.R. Day &amp; Sons included two of Louise’s brothers and they built a number of homes on Raymond Road near Boulevard and on Westland Avenue. Her father served as Justice of the Peace, and as the first chairman of the Business Men’s Association (later the Chamber of Commerce). Louise Day’s father figuratively and literally built community. Later they moved to a house on Outlook Avenue when the area had a 10 hole golf course. Louise Day graduated as the valedictorian from the West Hartford High School in 1902 in a class of four students, the first entering class at the school. She went on to study at Smith College, graduating in 1906. She taught for one year at Windsor High School until Superintendent William Hall persuaded her to come teach English and Math at her alma mater. She taught and coached there for four years, from 1908 to 1912. The basketball photo shows a 26 year old Louise Day as the coach of one of the first girls’ basketball teams at the West Hartford High School. Just as today, her athletes had long hair secured to keep it out of their face as they played on the court. Their knickers, stockings and neck ties, variously displayed, showed the individuality of each of the young women who built the team. Though no one in the picture is smiling, they exhibit a sense of determination and pride, and respect for their coach, qualities that Louise Day carried through her life.

Between 1912 and 1915, Louise Day left West Hartford to be secretary to the superintendent of the Horace Mann School in New York. When she came home, Louise married Ward Duffy (1891-1961), the year he graduated from Trinity College. She met him at the West Hartford High School where he was a student graduating in 1911. Duffy’s family lived at 208 North Main Street in the John Whitman house. Ward’s father, Frederick had been a high school teacher in upstate New York, but looked for a place to live where he could farm. He found their house along a section of Trout Brook which was called Whitman Falls. His wife Elizabeth grew up on a 400 acre farm just south of the Canadian border. Duffy “farmed from the book,” and grew a herd of Jersey cattle and sold milk. He ran for office and served on the first Town Council in 1921. He later became editor of the Hartford Times. Louise and Ward Duffy had five children: two boys and three girls. Louise ran the household and raised her children (born between 1917 and the mid-1920s). She was one of the founders of the Hall High School PTO in the late 1920s. As Duffy got involved in the political world, first in the Connecticut Woman’s Suffrage Association with Katharine Houghton Hepburn, and then, in 1923, at age 38 she helped found the League of Women Voters in West Hartford. The purpose of the League, was to get women politically involved in voting and running for office. And run she did! In 1924, she ran as a Democrat for the 5th Senatorial District seat in the General Assembly against Republican Huntington P. Meech, a 46 year old insurance underwriter for Hartford Fire Insurance. Duffy campaigned supporting the Democratic platform which unabashedly appealed to liberal people. She wholeheartedly supported the Child Labor Amendment to ban child labor. She also supported shorter hours for women in industry. She supported good education and felt she would be a good representative in the legislature because of her background as a teacher. She said the “supreme question in this election was whether the state government should be run by the people or by one man who dominated everything.” Though she lost to the Republican, she continued her interest in public service. In 1925 she tried to run for the Town Council (as the first woman to run) but could not secure the nomination for the Center District. In 1932, Duffy went to Chicago as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. She sat in the front row at the convention taking in the the first speech ever given at a convention by a nominated presidential candidate, Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Connecticut delegation was sharply divided between Al Smith and FDR, and Duffy put her support with FDR. After he was nominated, according to the Hartford Courant, she “was among the members of the Connecticut group who attended an after the business session and met the candidate and Mrs. Roosevelt in their informal reception.” From there, Duffy took on the mantle of the “New Guard” of leaders of the Democratic Party in Connecticut. She served as vice president of the Connecticut Federation of Democratic Women in 1934 and at the same time served as the Vice President of the Connecticut State League of Women Voters. In West Hartford, the council appointed her to the West Hartford Library Board (1936 to 1938). The Town Council appointed Duffy to the school board in 1938 and she served until 1948. She was the first Democrat on the Board in 15 years, and just the second woman. She was quickly named secretary and served through the end of the Great Depression, World War II and the rapid suburbanization that began after the war. Duffy served statewide as well. She chaired the state Child Welfare Association and was a member of the Connecticut Public Welfare Council. She used her skills as an advocate for those without a voice. She met with the Prison Association to coordinate juvenile and adult probation services. And her testimony at numerous state legislative hearings can still be read in the Connecticut State Library collection. In October 1935, Duffy headed a five member State Commission to Study the Pauper Laws. The Commission, named by Governor Wilbur Cross in the middle of the Great Depression, was prompted by the passage in August 1935 of the federal Social Security Act, establishing a federal system of old-age benefits for workers, victims of industrial accidents, the unemployed, dependent mothers and children, the blind and the physically handicapped. Until this act, it had been families and towns who took care of the poor. With the Great Depression, towns were no longer capable of fulfilling that responsibility and people were no longer willing to accept that poverty came with old age. Here in Connecticut, Duffy continued to be concerned about the stigma attached to monetary help from the government and the term “pauper.” The term had the connotation of being poor, “shiftless, incompetent and derelict,” and as the state and federal government turned to providing old age assistance checks of $30 per month, Duffy and her commission wanted to change that stigma tied to government issued aid. At that time, anyone receiving town aid was named a pauper. Duffy’s commission found that the history of being a pauper in 1635 included all needy people. Slowly, people were removed from the weight of the pauper designation: in 1650, neglected children, in 1699 the insane, in 1711 the diseased, in 1812 the deaf, and in 1820 the blind were no longer considered paupers. The unemployed on direct relief, those who did not work regularly, and those who were retired were still considered paupers in 1935. Duffy and her Commission were able to remove senior citizens getting an old-age pension from the list. In 1946, as a member of the League of Women Voters and the Board of Education, she helped write a press release urging the Town Council to appoint another woman to the Board of Education. It was not until 1958 that this became an elected Board. Duffy’s public service exemplifies a woman who used her abilities to improve the lives of others, both as a role model and a spokesperson for people who didn’t have a strong public voice. From her position, she saw government as a force of good in building community and she acted on her beliefs. Those values which include respect and compassion continue to be carried on at the school named after her in 1949. The League of Women Voters: Defining Citizenship Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, October 2010 In February 1920, suffragists founded the League of Women Voters to crusade for “the success of democracy.” The founders of the non-partisan organization figured that their job would take five years to teach the 20 million new women voters how to participate in a democracy and then they would disband. Ninety years later, the League continues its work. The West Hartford League, founded in 1923, continues to educate voters and help get out the vote, making West Hartford a model town for civic engagement. How League members defined what an educated voter knew is instructive to us as we look to vote in November 2010. When the West Hartford League first began in 1923, according to past-president Mary Everett, the meetings were social. The League secretary noted “November 3, at the home of Mrs. S” where members gathered in hats and gloves and drank tea, socialized and often listened to a speaker. Soon, though the activist women realized that socializing was not doing enough to educate new voters. By February 1924, Mrs. E.E. Stiles president, said that the league would organize a “motor corps” to drive women to the Town Hall to register to vote. The League targeted West Hartford’s 2,200 women voters who had not registered. The movement was purely non-partisan and the idea was to “waken the women to their civic responsibilities.” They registered 940 voters out of a population of 9,000. At the local election in mid-March 1924, West Hartford residents cast twice as many ballots as ever before in West Hartford’s history. Mrs. Ivar Lundgaard, of the West Hartford League entered a contest with The Woman’s Home Companion magazine on behalf of the League and won! The magazine editors knew only 26% of newly enfranchised women had exercised the franchise and they encouraged groups to share their success stories. The West Hartford League won $150. Once the women were registered to vote, the League offered classes to educate new voters. Members needed to know about state and local issues and chairs of committees took on the task of educating their members. Those who came to the March 1924 meeting heard Mr. Christopher M. Gallop, president of the West Hartford Chamber of Commerce, talk about West Hartford elections. Gallup, an officer at Travelers Insurance Company, was one of the first advocates in West Hartford for the Council-Manager system of government and he helped make West Hartford the first in Connecticut to adopt this system in 1919. Gallup and his wife lived on Steele Road, and Mrs. Gallup served as Secretary on the Board of the League. She became involved in the national League and traveled as a delegate to several national conventions in the 1920s. Gallop lectured on how to vote in local elections. In the 1920s, voters chose their 15 Town Council members by district. Voters chose five councilors from the East District, five from the Center, three from the Charter Oak District, one from South District, and one from Elmwood. Republicans controlled the town, but the Council was seen as a bipartisan affair, with healthy debate about police protection, roads, and educational spending. The Town Council appointed the Board of Education. Women were thought to have more interest in education, but the first women did not get appointed to the Board until 1931. Two women were appointed in that year, Grace Honiss and Mrs. Edward Lorenz; they both had been elected to the Town Council as well. Louise Duffy, president of the Parent Teachers Association spoke on “Two Types of Politicians” and distinguished between machine politicians, who she said worked for their own interest, and the type of politician who served the common good. Duffy, who had just come off her loss in a 1924 state election, was married to Ward Duffy, the editor of the Hartford Times. She had a reputation as a liberal with an iron will. That year, Duffy ran for State Senator as a Democrat in the 5th Senatorial District. She shared the podium at a political rally at Yale in October 1924 with New York’s Governor Alfred Smith and Alabama Governor Brandon. Duffy ran against West Hartford’s Republican Representative Huntington P. Meech. Duffy did not carry a single town in the district. According to the Hartford Courant, “no doubt many Democrats voted against her on account of her pledge to vote for ratification of the federal Child Labor Amendment if elected.” Though she lost this election, her advocacy for democracy and for children continued, as she became chair of the State Child Welfare Association, a member of the Library Board, and a member of the Board of Education for 11 years from the late 1930s to the 1940s. She was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from West Hartford in 1932. While Duffy ran for Senate she served as the chair of the special committee on the Citizenship School of the League. Duffy organized the first school conducted by a local unit in the state. She ran the “school” over the course of three weeks. The first set of lectures was on the machinery of national, state, county, and town government. Professors from Trinity College and Columbia University ran these sessions. The second course focused on World Politics. Lectures included The World Today and America’s Part in It, History of the Peace Movement, Europe and the World Peace Movement, and How Shall We Lessen the Possibility of War? The second set of lectures addressed political culture in the United States with sessions dedicated to a History of Political Parties in the United States, a Study of Platforms focusing on economic and political theories, honesty in government, education, civil service, conservation, foreign relations, tariff, taxes and finance, agriculture, labor, railroads, and civil liberties. Even without television and the internet, Duffy’s attendees must have felt well equipped to cast their votes in November. The next spring she ran again, this time for Town Council from the Center District and lost. However, she continued working for the common good through the league, the Parent Teacher Association and then the Board of Education. As election day draws near in 2010, the League of Women Voters, now 90 years old in Connecticut and 87 years old in West Hartford, continues its bipartisan work to educate voters through candidate debates and voter profiles. In 2010, the press has so few reporters covering local elections, finding out about the candidates and their issues is left to the League and our local access channel WHCTV. Their work to forge a successful democracy is an on-going project for all citizens. Women in the General Assembly Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, October 2006 On November 7, 2006, West Hartford voters will have the chance to do something they haven’t done in 22 years: elect a woman to the state legislature. Republican Barbara Carpenter and Democrat Beth Bye are squaring off in the 19th District, guaranteeing that the 19th District will be represented by a woman. West Hartford has a long history of electing women to public office, but the road to elective office has not always been easy. Most of those elected came through the “training ground” of the League of Women Voters, not through traditional political channels. The League began as a continuation of the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association. Louise Duffy helped organize the West Hartford League in September 1923, (two years after the state and national Leagues) just three years after women won the right to vote. The leadership in the Connecticut Woman’s Suffrage Association and the Connecticut Women’s Party became the leadership in the League. In 1929, Grace (Mrs. William T.) Honiss, the Vice President of the League was elected as the first woman to the West Hartford Town Council. At that time, candidates ran in each of five districts to gain a West Hartford Town Council seat. Honiss, of Concord Street was a Republican and ran unopposed. She graduated from Wheaton College in 1921, so may have been only about 30 when first elected. She was elected again in 1930 and 1931. In 1930, a Hartford Courant article proclaimed, “Women Want School Board Memberships.” A group of women circulated a petition to the Town Council, asking for a study to enlarge the Board to make room for women to serve. Until 1958, the Board of Education was appointed by the Town Council. Honiss started the petition among women in the League of Women Voters. The petition had some effect as Honiss was appointed to the Board in 1931 at the same time she served on the Town Council. In 1931, Mrs. Edward Lorenz, at age 45, was elected to the Town Council. She, like Mrs. Honiss, was also appointed to the School Board. Lorenz lived on West Hill Drive and was involved in the League of Women Voters, the YWCA, the Charity Organization Society, and the Community Chest. Louise Duffy, as early as 1934, was considered to be one of the “New Guard” leaders of the Democratic Party in the state at the same time as she served as the Vice President of the Connecticut State League of Women Voters. Duffy was an avid Democrat and she was involved on the local, state and national levels. She was the vice president of the Connecticut Federation of Democratic Women’s club. One of her favorite memories was sitting in the front row for Franklin Roosevelt’s speech which included “we have nothing to fear, but fear itself.” She was the chair of the state Child Welfare Association and a member of the Connecticut Public Welfare Council. She also helped to found the Hall High PTO. Duffy served on the town’s library board from 1936 to 1938. She was appointed to the school board in 1938 and served until 1948. In 1946, as a member of the League and the Board of Education, she helped write a press release urging the Town Council to appoint another woman to the Board of Education. Because of her dedication to the education of children, in 1950, the Board of Education decided to name the next elementary school for her. Between 1948 and 1974, a number of women won election to the Town Council and the Board of Education. But it took until 1974, for a West Hartford woman to be elected to statewide office. In 1973, Democrat Joan Kemler began her bid to be the first West Hartford woman elected to the state legislature. Kemler got her start in politics, like the three women before her, in the League of Women Voters. In the early 1970s, Kemler was Vice President of the United Way of Greater Hartford. As a woman, Kemler was shunned by Democratic Party Chair Harry Kleinman and the Democratic Party and was forced to a primary. In the primary, she defeated the party endorsed candidate and a petitioning candidate, both male. Kemler was interested in expanding Project Concern (now Project Choice) busing program and was accused of supporting “reverse busing.” In the campaign, she stated clearly that she did not support reverse busing. Kemler believed that some people were interested in her candidacy because she was a woman. In the November election, she won 6,800 to 3,500. She was elected five times from the 18th District between 1975 and 1984. Republican Dorothy Barnes was the second woman elected to statewide office for three terms from 1977 to 1982. She first ran for the 21st Assembly District which included Elmwood and Farmington. She ran against Tom Clark first in 1974 and ran again in 1976. Republican Maureen Baronian served the town in the state legislature for three terms between 1981 and 1986. She was a stockbroker who ran and won in 1980. Republican Anne Streeter served in the state Senate from 1981 to 1986 after serving on the Town Council from 1975 to 1981. Though neither candidate for the 19th Assembly District in 2006 had their political education in the League of Women Voters, both women will be beneficiaries of the League’s involvement in local elections. When they square off in the League’s debate and answer the Voter Guide Questionnaire, they will become part of the League’s legacy here in town. A West Hartford Woman’s “Success” at Travelers Insurance Company Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, March 2013 West Hartford’s Eleanor Boyle’s obituary from August 14, 2012 said, “Prior to retiring in 1985, Eleanor was a Purchasing Agent at Travelers Insurance Company for 47 years.” When I read this line, I realized I had interviewed Boyle 27 years earlier in 1989 for a study of working women at Travelers. Her successful career at Travelers from 1938 to 1985 symbolized the role of women in the white collar workplace in the mid- 20th century. Successful careers for insurance men and women took distinct paths into the 1980s. Though the same success rhetoric was trumpeted to men and women, the company made sure that “success” applied differently to men and women. While successful men became company officers, women rose to become an officer’s private secretary, or a supervisor of women in the steno or typing pool. In the new white collar workplaces of the 20th century corporation, management developed job ladders which men climbed, not through years of experience, but by merit. Men advanced by being comparatively better than other men. This encouraged the competitive spirit between white-collar workers while blue-collar workers tended to develop a more cooperative spirit. For a long time, labor historians and employers assumed women did not strive for success or have ambition. Eleanor Boyle belies that assumption. Historians, like the employers, assumed women would be docile and compliant in the workplace. These historians assumed that women resigned themselves to their fates in boring and repetitive jobs with few if any chances for meaningful promotion. Most women expected that they would work only for a few years until they married, and therefore had no reason to be ambitious. But for women like Boyle, who never married, their work lives broke the mold. Women’s historians have taken a different look and showed that women developed their own work culture to take some control of their workday and developed a woman controlled culture at work. And, at Travelers, women were encouraged to “push for success.” Boyle entered the workforce a month shy of her 18th birthday in 1938, near the end of the Great Depression. She vividly remembered her first day at work in the stenographic department. She had applied ten times before she finally got the job. Boyle graduated from Stafford Springs High School and because she couldn’t get a job she moved in with her aunt in Hartford and went to Morse’s Business School. The Depression hadn’t let up, so she went to Morse’s during the summer and then after Labor Day. She said she used to cry when she saw the other kids on the bus going to to work because she didn’t have a job. Finally in the Fall of 1938 she was hired at $14 per week. By that time the federal government had started taking a Social Security out and her wages didn’t go far. Boyle worked first as as an ediphone operator where she had “things in her ears all day long.” She took dictation from cylinders. By 1940, she went out and took dictation directly from an officer and then come back to the steno pool and typed it up. She worked in the steno pool for about 4 ½ years. Her supervisors kept track of her production by measuring the amount she typed with a ruler. Then she got the opportunity to take dictation from Miss Gilbert, an officer in the Group Department steno pool, whose “girl had left.” She was a “nervous wreck” on her try out, but got the job as her secretary. According to Boyle, “all the women in the stenographic were women; there weren’t any men in those days.” She worked for Howard for eight years. In 1950, she was promoted to an administrative assistant of the steno pool. Finally in 1959, after 21 years at the Travelers, she became the first woman buyer in the Purchasing Department. When she was offered the job, Mr. Smith told her to go home and sleep on it to decide if she wanted it. Boyle asked if this was a better opportunity, and Smith replied “yes.” Boyle said, “I don’t have to go home and sleep on it, I’ll take it.” For Boyle, perseverance, loyalty, and good work paid off in a higher position with the company. Once she joined the purchasing department, none of the men with the same job helped her. They didn’t want her there. She had two friends who helped her. One was a secretary (with whom she shared an apartment) to the Purchasing Agent and another was the secretary to another officer who took her work and typed the orders to help her. According to Boyle, “the men were trying to defeat me and have me give up. But I was determined that I was going to make it. So I plugged along and it was a very interesting and very challenging job.” She found that the sales people from whom she bought various items also helped her. In 1966 her big boss promoted her to Assistant Purchasing agent, but they never made her an officer. She said they played this promotion up in the paper as she was the first woman given the opportunity to be a buyer. But still, she did not get cooperation from any of the men in the office. She said “I always had the feeling that I had to work much harder at it than they (the men) did because they were watching all the time… hoping I’d stub my toe, but I guess they eventually respected me.” Near her retirement in the early 1980s, she compared her salary with a young male co-worker who had been at the company for only a few years. She found that after more than 45 years at the Travelers, she made only $1,000 more per year than he did. She was never made a company officer. Finally, by the mid-1980s, when Boyle was ready to retire, she found that they were starting to promote women. Even in the mid-1980s, she said, there was still a feeling that they weren’t going to push a woman. Or they would have “little pets” who they would promote, but there was not a program to promote women. Finally, they gradually began to bring “girls” into jobs. In the end, Boyle said she “had a very happy time in the Travelers.” But she still resented that “of all I gave to the company, they didn’t make me an officer.” While opportunities for young women began to open up, and Boyle could say that for women “times have changed,” she was stuck with a set of lower expectations for women that kept her from reaching her potential or getting the pay and benefits that she could have earned had she been a man. William H. Hall and our “Highest Duty” Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, February 2010 My friend, Trinity Professor Jack Dougherty, and I were recently debating when it was that West Hartford began promoting its successful public schools as a selling point to attract families to settle in West Hartford versus surrounding towns. He held that West Hartford did not start competing for residents via their schools until the late 1950s. It seems like the commitment to good schools as a part of the civic virtue of the town, however, starts earlier. A look at the schools’ history begins with one-room schoolhouses. By 1902, the town had consolidated its nine school districts. Adolph C. Sternberg was the Acting School Visitor (head of schools) until 1896. He was served in the General Assembly from 1895-6. He felt that the schools needed more skilled supervision than he could give them, and he arranged to have the Secretary of the State Board of Education, Prof. Charles D. Hine, assume the supervisor position until 1897. When Hine realized it was more than a part-time job, he hired high school principal William H. Hall and the position transformed into the Superintendent of Schools. Hall held that position for 25 years until 1922 when he was 77. Upon Hall’s retirement, Lloyd Bugbee, the Principal of the West Hartford High School, a youngster compared to Hall, stepped in and served as Superintendent until 1947. William H. Hall, (1845-1934), the first historian of the town, wrote his history of West Hartford when he was 83 years old, and published it in 1930. He was born in West Hartford. In 1872, at age 27, Hall was hired as principal of the old West Hartford High School and acting school visitor. This photo, taken in 1875, is in his time as principal. At age 83, he was still involved in the schools, teaching local history for an hour per week to the 5th and 6th graders at the big elementary schools in town.

Hall, wrote “A Historical Sketch of West Hartford” for the dedication of the new red brick Town Hall, in which he praised the school system. At the time, the town had about 3,000 residents and was still a farm town. Hall was the Superintendent and a town historian in his own right, and he used his speech to glorify and celebrate the town. He related the history of West Hartford from 1679 –- the first settlement –- to 1902. He believed that to understand the present, the citizens needed to not only know the past, but also understand their indebtedness to those who came before them. From 1713 to 1796, according to Hall, the Ecclesiastical Society of the West Division supported five schools up and down Main Street. He argued, “our fathers made very wise and generous provision for the educational interests of the community,” an expression of civic virtue. From 1796 to 1855, the state gained a role in school governance as the General Assembly established a School Fund with the proceeds from the sale of Western Reserve lands in Ohio. A state-mandated School Society managed the funds for the West Division (West Hartford). By 1885 the schools were consolidated under the town’s new government. Hall believed that the successful town residents who went to schools here demonstrated how good the schools were. Hall listed Noah Webster, Theodore Sedgwick who became Speaker of the House and a U.S. Senator, Titus Hosmer, a member of Congress, John Woodruff a judge in New York State, Benjamin Burr who helped establish the glove industry in Gloversville, New York, James Seymour, banker, Ebenezer Belden, printer and publisher of the first daily newspaper in New York City, more than 25 ministers, including Lemuel Haynes, a “colored boy” born here and who became a successful minister in Vermont. His examples of success seem to be individuals who gave back to their communities. Hall concluded: We certainly have good people, good homes, good churches, good schools, good laws, good officials, good roads and good public buildings. But none of these are so good that they do not admit of improvement, and it should be our constant aim to attain to that which is not simply better, but best. Let us not forget, however, that our highest duty, our noblest endeavor, our grandest opportunity and our true success as a community are to be found in such use and improvement of all these advantages and blessings as will result in the training of our children and youth in character and life so that they may most worthily serve God and their fellowmen in their day and generation. Hall’s priority to make educating children the “highest duty” led to big changes in the school system. As the population grew, so did his plans for the school system. West Hartford was on the cutting edge when it opened two junior high schools in 1922, only the second and third junior highs in the state. Ground had already been broken for the new high school. When Lloyd Bugbee became Superintendent in 1922, he requested that the State Department of Education do a report on the state of West Hartford’s schools. State Commissioner A. B. Meredith spoke at Webster Hall in the Noah Webster Library, invited by the Democratic Women’s Club to deliver his report. William Hall presided over the meeting. While Supt. Bugbee praised his teachers, Meredith and the State Board criticized the town for falling behind in both its buildings and its student achievement. Meredith pointed out the physical needs of the schools and the changes needed in the course of study. There was a desperate need for a new high school, and yet the cornerstone had already been laid. Three of the seven elementary schools were so crowded that they ran double sessions. Again, Bugbee quickly responded with the Beach Park School (1926), Morley School (1926), an eight-room addition on Smith School (1926) and Elmwood School (1928). As for student achievement, the elementary students were performing only slightly above average; the State Board felt Bugbee could expect more. Perhaps Bugbee was willing to receive the criticism and used it to his advantage to galvanize the public to support his building program. Still, there were some anecdotal signs of good results. On February 11, 1924, the Hartford Courant headline read “West Hartford’s Schools Praised: Men Prepared there Do Well at College, Say Dartmouth Authorities.” Dartmouth College sent several commendations to the Superintendent “commenting on the splendid preparatory training received by graduates of the West Hartford Schools.” Though its schools were not yet used to sell houses by 1925, the town leaders started to define civic virtue through caring about its schools. They did not yet provide the draw to the town that they would in the next 15 years. Remembering Beach Park School Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, September 2000 West Hartford has long prided itself on its excellent school system. Even before it came out from under the shadow of Hartford’s nationally recognized schools, West Hartford believed it was on the leading edge of educational philosophy and innovation. Whereas excellence today is measured by standardized national and state tests, in the first half of the 20th century, some educators measured success differently. In 1949, West Hartford Superintendent Lloyd Bugbee ran a school system which claimed to set trends around the country. He wrote: The things which we prize most, cannot be pictured, viz. the kind voices, the happy, eager faces, the glad exclamations, the joy of accomplished tasks, the pride in work well done, the growing children, and the general hum of happy industry. More and more do we need to seek the teacher who considers these to be of equal importance to the accumulation of facts – the teacher who desires to make each individual child in her classroom a more complete, wholesome and happy personality. Bugbee believed that the education provided at the Beach Park School, built on Steele Road and opened in February 1926 embodied this philosophy. As West Hartford’s population grew at the turn of the century from 3,100 in 1900 to 8,800 in 1920, the town had to adjust the way it educated its children. Superintendent William H. Hall consolidated the system of one-room district schools spread throughout the town in the early part of the century. These one-room schoolhouses had desks nailed to the floor and teachers who taught mainly by rote. The town began to invest in larger elementary schools, building Charter Oak School, in 1884 for grades K through 8 and the Center School (later Whitman School, the Hall High School Annex, and the Police Station) in 1896 as an elementary school. The Seymour School (later Smith School) opened in 1915. But it was the Beach Park School that helped put West Hartford on the educational map. With five acres of land donated by T. Belknap Beach (grandson of the founder of Travelers Insurance Co.) in 1925, the Beach Park School was the first in West Hartford to be built in a park-like setting. Beach wrote in the deed that no trees could be cut except for park purposes. The architect designed a building that was more like a home than an institution. The colonial structure and color scheme for the three-classroom building, finished in 1926, were a departure for school buildings. The Kindergarten Room exemplified this new educational philosophy. By the 1920s, educators realized the importance of education before students could grasp the “3 R’s.” The Kindergarten room resembled a large beautiful living room. It had an open fireplace at one end of the room, a four-foot basin with live goldfish, a piano, a slide, doll furniture, children’s rockers, and a sand table. Instead of bolting furniture to the floor, teachers could move the new furniture to adjust the classroom to the children’s daily needs. Educator John Dewey’s Progressive education ideas found a home in West Hartford. According to Bugbee, a school should have a “happy atmosphere and freedom which the preschool child enjoys at home. It is a place where children may live together working, playing and learning as they might do in a happy family.” The building enhanced the teachers’ abilities to reach these goals. The curriculum in the Kindergarten and the two primary classrooms, combining Grades One and Two, and the other, Grades Three and Four, began with the child’s interest and experiences. The teachers at Beach Park believed students learned by doing. They believed that once children had lived through an actual experience, it became the pupils’ own with a much fuller meaning than reading from a book. Thus, students took excursions and wrote and performed plays that gave them skills to meet a changing world. West Hartford’s practice of establishing a “model school” began with Beach Park. In 1927, the Fern Street School and in 1928 the Elmwood School both opened, patterned after the Beach Park School. Educators based based both on the progressive education model, built in park-like settings, with movable furniture. Beach Park’s three-room schoolhouse was soon bursting at its seams. West Hartford’s population grew from about 8,800 in 1920 to about 25,000 in 1930 to 44,000 in 1950. When the Hartford Golf Club sold some of its land, now known as Golf Acres, for development, enrollment grew even more. In 1929 the school added four classrooms giving the school one classroom per grade. In 1947, after a legal battle, the town took down trees to build a ball field. In 1949, administrators added an auditorium/playroom, a small kitchen, and a teachers’ room. The last remodeling as a public school came in 1961 adding an enlarged office and a conference room. By the 1960s, Beach Park had become something of an anomaly in town. With 13 other elementary schools, all at least twice as large, Beach Park became, according to a 1972 West Hartford News editorial, something of a “private country day school serving wealthy and socially prominent families in the northeast quadrant of town.” It was the only elementary school in town without a cafeteria. Students still walked home for lunch. Parent volunteers staffed the library. The public school closed in 1972, the victim of a restrictive deed, the beginning of declining school enrollment in West Hartford, and a desire for socio-economic integration in the elementary schools. In 1999, the Beach Park School reopened as Saint Joseph College School for Young Children. Much of the philosophy of the public school, embodied in both educational values and architecture, has been retained at the pre-school. The homelike atmosphere, the use of the outdoor woods as classroom, and the idea that education is based on actual real life situations are all part of the early childhood education center. The practice of model schools continues with West Hartford’s magnet schools, which have included Smith, Charter Oak and Norfeldt. School administrators give teachers in these schools the freedom to try innovative educational techniques in the hopes that they will become an integral part of the curriculum of the other schools. Town-wide math and science curriculum and foreign language instruction in 4th and 5th grades are a result of the innovations in these magnet schools. The School for Young Children in the restored Beach Park School is one of two Model Lab Schools in Connecticut. Visitors from all over visit the school just as they had visited the Beach Park School over a half a century ago. In 1949, Superintendent Lloyd Bugbee argued: If knowledge is to be loved for its own sake that which is now abstract and remote would be wedded in some way to practical life… We believe that the system at the Beach Park School is calculated to foster the child’s curiosity, to make the desire for knowledge a chronic and habitual one and to familiarize each child with the best methods of acquiring it by his own efforts. Bugbee’s educational philosophy, articulated in relationship to the Beach Park School, continues to make West Hartford’s school system excellent today. “Harmony, Cooperation and West Hartford First” Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, January 2008 A recent trip to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s library and home in Hyde Park, New York sparked a new interest in West Hartford during the Great Depression. It reminded me of asking my grandmother about the Depression when I was a young teacher. My grandfather had lost all his money in the 1929 stock market crash and my grandparents had gone from having two houses (one in Bronxville and one in Litchfield) and eight servants, to one house in Litchfield and one Irish servant named Bridie who worked for room and board. I still remember Grandma’s reply to my question about how the Depression affected her. “It brought the family together.” She remembered, in what historians argue is memory, not history. In West Hartford, memories would definitely differ over the impact of the Depression. Welfare cases went up from 29 in 1929 to over 500 in 1934. Police officers and teachers took a 10% pay cut. But statistics that show growth in the town provide a more complicated picture than the grim national statistics and provide a view into a community that both suffered and thrived in the 1930s. City directories, found both in the Town Hall and the Noah Webster Public Library provide a statistical view into a town on the move in the 1930s. Information from the 1930 and 1934 volumes represent ways citizens and government had to adjust to an economic downturn in which 1/3 of the workforce was out of work by 1934. The 1930 and 1934 Geer’s City Directory pages about West Hartford start with the quote, “Harmony, Cooperation and West Hartford First.” Each volume provided a page of current statistics and a page on the town’s history. The tables below represent some of the changes town residents faced in the early 1930s. Table 1: West Hartford Population and Services Year Population Native born Bonded debt Library volumes Telephones Churches 1930 24,936 85% $2,514,000 11,148 5,475 9 1934 est. 26,817 85% NA 24,778 7,600 10 This first table shows the population growing by 7.5% in just four years. The number of telephones increased by almost 40%. This phone increase is partially due to families adding phone in their household, but may also show the ubiquity of phones by the mid-1930s. The phone became a necessary household item. During times of depression, use of the library increased. This must have included an increase in the use of tax dollars for the more than doubling of the number of volumes in the library. Even those without money could enjoy reading during the Depression. Table 2: West Hartford Property and Financials Year Assessed valuation Mill rate Bank deposits Real estate transfers Building permits Value of permits 1930 $70,471,990 20 $2,055,663 1847 345 $6,315,945 1934 $64,458,830 16 $1,800,000 1050 93 $1,216,251 The statistics in Table 2 demonstrate a distinct economic downturn. The Grand List declined by almost 9 percent and the mill rate declined 20%. Clearly revenues for town government were down. West Hartford Bank and Trust, which opened in 1926, lost 12 percent of its assets in the economic downturn. Like other banks, it had to close because of Franklin Roosevelt’s Bank Holiday, directed in March of 1933. But it reopened and most investors kept their money there. Sale of homes dropped by 43%. The value of permits to build declined by 80% showing that building declined precipitously. FDR’s New Deal stepped into the building vacuum by establishing the Public Works Administration, which sponsored the building of both the Town Hall and the Noah Webster Library in 1935. Table 3: West Hartford Public Schools Year Public School Pupils Teachers Pupils per Teacher 1930 4011 180 15 1934 5078 189 27 The rapid growth in West Hartford’s population from 1920 to 1930 led to the construction of six new school buildings: Beach Park (1926), Morley (1927), Elmwood (1928), Talcott Junior High (1922), Plant Junior High (1922), and Hall High School (1924). But who would guess that in the first four years of the Depression, when the Grand List and the mill rate declined, that the school population would increase by 27 percent? And yet, the number of teachers grew by only 5 percent. Student teacher ratios almost doubled in just four years. The increase must have challenged the teachers and administration; at the same time, teaching is seen as a “depression-proof” employment in that the number of students attending schools tends to increase during economic downturns. Table 4: West Hartford Private Schools Year Private Schools Pupils Pupils per teacher Mt. St. Joseph Seminary for Girls 181 9 Kingswood School for Boys 160 11 American School for the Deaf 212 7 1930 Total 553 Mt. St. Joseph Seminary for Girls 105 6 Mt.

Though times were hard, increasingly, West Hartford residents sent their children to private schools, both parochial and independent, with an increase of 53% over four years. When times were hard, parents chose small class sizes for their children. West Hartford’s first post-secondary school arrived in 1932 with the opening of Mt. St. Joseph College, a junior college that began with 63 students. By 1933, the college became a four-year school, established primarily to train teachers. It wasn’t until 1936 that the college moved to its present location on Asylum and Steele and was renamed St. Joseph College. To survive the Depression, West Hartford’s government and business communities certainly yearned for “harmony, [and] cooperation…” to make “West Hartford first.” By analyzing the statistics of the era, the challenging times display contradictory evidence about standards of living dependent on economic status and age. West Hartford’s experiences in the early years of the Depression remind me how my grandmother’s memory could paint over the real difficulties people faced. Studying African-American Migration to the Suburbs Originally appeared with co-author Katie Campbell in West Hartford Life, September 2010 A few months ago, this column was about the discovery of restrictive covenants in West Hartford in the 1940s. Developers restricted where African-Americans could live in town and that clearly affected settlement patterns in the quickly growing suburb. But what were the patterns before the suburban developments? We do know that African-Americans were enslaved in West Hartford during the time of the American Revolution and we know that some, like Bristow, bought their freedom and lived in their own households. It is not clear how autonomous African-Americans were through the 19th century and into the 20th century, but by 1930, it is clear that three quarters of West Hartford’s African-Americans lived as servants in white people’s homes. They lived in nine of 15 census districts, with the largest number in the Northeast section of town, in the Hartford Golf Club area. As an historical source, the 1930 Census is rich. It reveals street addresses, notes if residents own their houses, their gender, their race, place of birth, parents’ place of birth and occupation. While the census is but a list of information, it provides data on people who may not leave other records and provides a more complex picture of the emerging suburb. The patterns of African-American settlement in Hartford in the early 20th century have been studied by sociologist Kurt Schlichting, of Fairfield University, and his colleagues in his 2006 article “Residential Segregation and the Beginning of the Great Migration of African-Americans to Hartford, Connecticut: a GIS-Based Analysis.” Schlichting and others explore the movement of African-Americans to Hartford in the first 20 years of the 20th century. His study showed a large increase in the African-American population in Hartford. “In 1900, over 80% of the total African-American population of the country lived in the southern states of the former Confederacy. During that decade from 1910 to 1920, about half a million migrants made the journey north,” he said. By 1920, African-Americans made up 3.1% of Hartford’s population and by 1930 it was up to 4%. Their level of independence depended on the jobs they could get. By 1930, some African-Americans moved to the suburbs. West Hartford’s population grew to about 25,000 by 1930. But only 129 African-Americans were recorded in the 1930 census pages, making up 0.5% of the town’s total residents. Of these 129 people, only 30, or about a quarter, lived in a household they headed themselves. One example of an African-American headed household was the Robinson family, who owned their home at 1070 Farmington Avenue, across from Riggs Avenue. The house was valued at $30,000. The head of household, Burrest, was 58 years old and had been married to Elizabeth for 22 years. He was born in Connecticut and his parents were born in Virginia and Massachusetts. He was a steamfitter and his wife was not employed. Burrest’s brother James was widowed and lived with the Robinsons. He was a gardener who helped to maintain the household. Economically, the Robinsons were independent. The Backer family, who were white, lived on Arundel Avenue, not far from the Robinson’s Farmington Avenue home. Lloyd Backer, a 39-year-old, married Nettiebelle who was 33. He was an assistant general agent with an insurance company. The Backers had four children ages six months to eight years old. The wife Nettiebelle, who was not employed, was born in Mississippi and her parents were born in the South as well. They hired Mary McMiller, a 24-year-old “Negro servant,” to care for their family. Mary was not married. She was born in Georgia, but had probably moved north with the great migration of African-Americans during the World War I decade. We can’t know what the dynamic was within the household, with the southern mistress. We can only guess about whether Mary ever interacted with the Robinsons, even though they lived about five blocks from each other. We can imagine that Mary was busy. On Mountain Road, an African-American family, the Plummers, and a white family, the Dewings, were considered part of the same household. Alexander and Gladys Plummer had been married for three years and in 1930 were listed as butler and cook, probably for the Dewing family. The Dewings, Harold (born in North Carolina) and Marjorie (born in New York), were both 46 years old and had been married for 21 years. Their house was worth $50,000. Dewing was a real estate official. They had three teenage children in the household. It seems likely that the Plummers lived in a rear apartment or an out-building on the Dewing property and took care of the Dewing family. Bloomfield’s demographic snapshot was quite different. That town’s population in 1930 had only reached 3,247, only one-eighth the size of West Hartford. The non-white residents recorded in the census numbers 121, almost as many as in West Hartford, and they made up a larger percentage of the town’s population at 4%. The east side of Bloomfield was nearly 5% nonwhite. Unlike in West Hartford, there were no non-white servants in Bloomfield. In fact, 99% of non-whites in Bloomfield lived in a household that was headed by a non-white. The majority of African-Americans living in West Hartford had varying degrees of autonomy. It is curious that both of the white families who had live-in servants had an adult born in the South. Historians await the release of the manuscript census from 1940 in 2012 to see if these servant relations persisted and if there was an increase in economically independent African-American households. But from the patterns established in Bloomfield, it seems more likely that those African-Americans with means would choose Hartford’s northern rather than its western neighbor. Note: Katie Campbell is a senior at Trinity College working on the “On the Line” project with Prof. Jack Dougherty. She completed the 1930 census research and provided basic outlines of this article.

Sources for this article include the interview by Mims Butterworth, The Kingswood-Oxford Magazine Spring and Winter 2002, and Oxford Remembers. In a democracy based on merit, education is often viewed as the path to a successful life. Most people who consider education in this way speak about public schools. In West Hartford, realtors would tell you that many people move to town for the public education system. But, every year about 10% of the secondary school students in town attend private schools. West Hartford has several private and parochial schools and the Oxford School, which was founded in 1909 and merged with Kingswood in 1972, is one of them. Mims Butterworth’s interview with Helen van Dyck Brown in 1997 illuminates the value of a private school education. She taught science at Oxford from 1931 to 1970, and lived in West Hartford in the Sunnyreach neighborhood, just north of the University of Hartford off Bloomfield Avenue, starting in 1940. Her personality, her intellect and, some might argue, her antics made for a memorable teacher and a memorable education for her students. Van Dyck Brown graduated from Barnard College in 1927 with a major in Biology and a minor in the Fine Arts. When she went to Oxford, she taught both Biology and art. Oxford was first established as a “country day school.” In the early 20th century, there were private boarding schools, but the philosophy of the day school was that teachers and parents had to work together to shape the bodies, minds and character of young people in a setting away from the hazards of the city in a wholesome school environment. When the school was founded, Hartford had over 100,000 people, while West Hartford had only about 4,800 residents and was still more of a farm town than a suburb. What makes a private school worth paying for? For some it is the low teacher to student ratio and the high level of involvement of the faculty members in the school community. It is the sense of belonging that is built around a common moral and educational purpose, shared ideals, and the sense of empowerment and control that comes with a small, private community. The Oxford community was just such a place; teachers pulled on their strengths and interests to foster lifelong learning. Before van Dyck arrived at Oxford, it enrolled students from Kindergarten through the 12th grade. In 1924 for instance, Oxford had an enrollment of 103 students, 81 girls in the junior school and 22 girls in the high school. By 1931, enrollment had grown to over 250 despite the Depression. Between 15 and 20 girls graduated each year from Oxford in the 1930s. Until the 1930s, most girls attended Oxford and then went on to boarding school and “finished” there. Often only four or five students graduated from the school in the 1920s. But, starting in 1936, the school discontinued the primary grades and focused more on being a college preparatory school. For van Dyck Brown, after she married in 1933 and had her own two children, she sent them to Oxford’s Junior School. In the 7th grade, she sent them to Hartford’s Noah Webster Elementary School. She said that in the early 1940s, “We didn’t think much of the West Hartford School system, so we sent them to Noah Webster.” She thought the Hartford Public Schools could provide “a rough and tumble type of schooling to make it in the world.” Her sons went there for two years until they could go to Loomis. When van Dyck arrived at Oxford, the curriculum depended, to a great degree on the background of the teachers. The philosophy was to expose students to a breadth of academic subjects and the arts. Girls took American History, English, French, Latin, mathematics, geography, penmanship, spelling, physical education, cooking and sewing classes, gym, singing, and piano. Each day began with a non-denominational Protestant chapel service. By the 1940s, service became a top priority and students got involved in community service projects as a regular part of the school experience. Promoting democracy and individual responsibility were official visions of the school. The administration and teachers wanted to educate the heart, the body, and the mind. Van Dyck remembered lunch time when teachers and students were served a hot dinner. The faculty and students ate together and the faculty was to remind students of their table manners in their continuous effort to educate the whole child. In good weather, the students walked from Highland Street up Fern Street past the hill where Mt. St. Joseph Academy stood (Vanderbilt or now West Hill) until the paving ended at Quaker Lane. Dancing, basketball, track and field, soccer, and gymnastics were some of the physical activities provided for the young women. When she first arrived, during the Depression, she did not have a full schedule and she was asked to teach manuscript writing. This was a new movement, to teach what we would call “printing” today, instead of script. Van Dyck read up on it and taught it. She gave a lecture on it to parents and this is how she met her husband, Wallace Brown. He was a doctor in Hartford, and had a daughter attending the school. She was only one of two married women teachers at Oxford in the 1930s. Faculty members realized their fortunes were tied up with the school as well, and when van Dyck first arrived at Oxford, she and other faculty members agreed to take a 20% pay cut. Van Dyck was famous for her science course. She turned the “Nature Study” program at the Oxford School into a Science Department in the 1930s. Van Dyck hired a chemistry teacher and taught a General Science course to give the school a Science Department. That was in 1933. Van Dyck Brown’s reputation was to bring the real world into her classroom, teaching ecology early on, and getting the students involved in labs. Van Dyck Brown was also famous for adding a course in basic auto repair. She taught the girls about engine parts and how to do basic maintenance repairs. One student claimed this was the most valuable course she ever took. In a tribute of “Van” written by colleague Muriel Forbes, she describes her room as the Porch Room which looked out on Prospect Avenue and had quotations on the blackboard, not necessarily about Biology, but about life. She challenged the students to think about their relevance to what they were studying and to their lives outside the classroom. This practice fit well with the model of educating the whole student. In early June 2003, the Kingswood-Oxford Middle School at 695 Prospect Avenue saw its last private school students. Many of the buildings will soon be torn down, though the original mansion, bought by Oxford in 1924, will remain and the town of West Hartford will build a magnet middle school incorporating this building. The spirit of a love for learning, building a sense of community, and educating head, heart and body will continue at 695 Prospect Avenue, but this time as a public school. Universalists Celebrate 75 Years in Town Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, July 2006 The Universalist Church of West Hartford (originally known as the Church of the Redeemer) moved out of Hartford 75 years ago, following the pattern of St. John’s Episcopal Church which moved out of the city in 1907. St. Brigid Roman Catholic Church was established in Elmwood in 1918 as a mission church of St. Lawrence O’Toole in Hartford, and presaged the move of Congregation Beth Israel in 1936. The movement of these houses of worship fueled and reflected the movement of people to West Hartford and increased the religious diversity of the town. West Hartford’s only church until 1855 was the Congregational Church in the center of town. St. James Episcopal (1855) on South Main Street where Friendly’s is today, and the Baptist Church (1859) on the site of the Farmington Savings Bank in the center were followed by the Elmwood Chapel (1876). St. John’s and St. Brigid brought the number of churches in town to five. In 1920 the Swedish Methodist Church on the Boulevard was built and the next year a Swedish Lutheran Church opened on Park Road near Oakwood Avenue, reflecting the large number of Swedes who moved here in the first two decades of the 20th century. In 1926, St. Thomas the Apostle moved to Farmington Avenue, just east of Trout Brook and then in 1931, the Church of the Redeemer (the Universalist Church) opened on Fern Street. It was the first church built in town north of Farmington Avenue, and it was built on open land. In 1936, a third house of worship, Congregation Beth Israel, moved out of Hartford to Farmington Avenue following the suburbanization trend of the Episcopal and Universalist churches, bringing the total number of houses of worship to ten. West Hartford was well on its way to being a suburb when the Universalist Church opened at the beginning of the Great Depression. The population grew from about 9,000 to about 25,000 in the previous decade. Between 1922 and 1931, the town built eight schools including three junior high schools and a high school. The only two built north of Farmington Avenue were the Beach Park School on Steele Road and Morley School on Fern Street, showing that development in the north and west ends of town was only beginning. The Universalist Church of West Hartford opened its doors to the townspeople on Monday, April 5, 1931. According to the Hartford Courant, “throngs of people visited the buildings of the new Church of the Redeemer, on Fern Street, West Hartford.” In 2006, the church celebrated its 75th year in West Hartford; its tradition of being a free liberal faith continues. When the church was built on Fern Street, there was only one other house, built in 1930, on the stretch of Fern Street between Trout Brook and Main Street. Plots had been laid out in the neighborhood just to the north, with a number of houses on Linwold Street built between 1928 and 1931. About this time, the town had begun to feel the effects of the Great Depression and Town Manager Benjamin Miller developed public works jobs for unemployed men in town, working in the town parks, helping to dig sewers and work on the roads. The welfare rolls increased, and Miller felt it was necessary for the government to intervene to stop the downward cycle. He would have embraced the building of the Church of the Redeemer at 433 Fern Street for it provided jobs for masons, bricklayers, electricians, plumbers and carpenters. The Church of the Redeemer’s journey to Fern Street began back in 1821, when Boston’s Hosea Ballou preached in Hartford, proclaiming that there was no punishment for sins after death. He preached that love, not sin, was the most powerful force in religion. He believed that atonement, or as he called it, reconciliation, not damnation, was at the core of a person’s relationship with God. He preached about the holiness and happiness of all people; he believed that the spirit of the gospel of the Son of God was to love your enemies, and render good for evil. Ballou’s beliefs were radical in the early 19th century, especially when the ideas of the Second Great Awakening swept the eastern seaboard as evangelicals tried to fend off the spread of religious rationalism. According to these religious revivalists, converts had to submit totally to a vengeful and all powerful God. Those who were “born again” believed that a life of good works on earth could earn grace in the eyes of God at death. The Universalists reacted to the evangelical belief that there was judgment at death. For Universalists, God was a God of love who did not judge. They were laughed at and ridiculed for this belief. When Ballou first started preaching, there were about 18 Universalists ministers in the whole country, and by the time he was buried in 1852, there were over 800,000 Universalists. In 2006, there are over 1000 congregations in the United States. Ballou’s message hit fertile ground in Hartford and disgruntled Congregationalists formed the “First Independent Universalist Society of the City of Hartford” and by 1824, built their first meeting house on Central Row across from the Old State House. By 1860, this building was too small and the church moved to the location of the present day Travelers Tower. In 1906, the church moved west to Asylum Hill. There was a time in the 20th century when it was thought the Universalists would merge with the Asylum Hill Congregational Church, but it kept its own identity. Each of the first three sites was prime real estate and each sale paid the expense of building the next church. In November 1929, just a week after the stock market crashed, the church voted to erect a new building in West Hartford. They gathered $13,000 within the next eight weeks to buy the plot of land, and with the uncertainty of the economy, their hope, and their faith, they went ahead with their plan. Walter Crabtree, a Hartford architect designed this colonial revival church as well as many houses in West Hartford in the 1930s. The congregation laid the cornerstone in 1930, and the building was finished in the early spring 1931 at a cost of $185,000. Richard McLaughlin was the first minister in West Hartford. The congregation continued to grow at the Church of the Redeemer. In 1961, the Unitarians and Universalists merged to become the Unitarian Universalist Association. In 1962, the name of the West Hartford Church changed to The Universalist Church of West Hartford, and an addition was built which included classrooms and a multi-purpose hall. The membership of the church peaked in the late 60s and early 70s, just as the population of West Hartford topped out at about 73,000. The church is growing again, signaled by the reinstatement of two services on Sunday in 2001, with the vigorous leadership of Jan K. Nielsen, providing a home for religious liberals from around the region. Today the Universalist Church of West Hartford is one of the twenty largest UUA congregations in the country. The town of West Hartford matured as a suburb in the last 75 years. The area around the Universalist Church is completely developed. West Hartford offers almost 40 different houses of worship, which is four times more than the ten offered 75 years ago. The wide variety of religious choices is a unique strength of the town. Democracy and the Town Hall Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, November 2001 Democracy is a messy system. Decisions can take years to make because democracy provides ways for every manner of people to express their opinion and it often ends up dividing a community. Sometimes democracy is infuriating: representatives hesitate and compromise too soon, elected leaders often face unjust criticism, and it is often difficult to question the majority. But this messy process, occurring over and over again, and what it symbolizes helps define our democratic tradition. West Hartford’s Town Hall history is fraught with democratic hesitation and expressions of opinions. Not only did West Hartfordites fight about building new Town Halls, they spent much time arguing about what to do with the old ones. Between 1934 and 1957, the local leadership and the citizens joined together to build the new town hall and then squabbled for 20 years about what to do with the old building. West Hartford was a solidly Republican town from its independence in 1854 until the 1970s. Even so, political tension existed, and Republicans were not afraid to take advantage of help from the Democratic federal government in the 1930s to build. Studies of the need for a new Town Hall came as early as February 1934, from three civic groups – the Chamber of Commerce, the Civitan Club, and the Exchange Club. They wrote a letter to the Town Council providing reasons for a new municipal building after a prolonged and careful study of the town’s need. The Council drafted plans for a “civic center” in the ensuing year, but chose to act on the town hall when they saw the possibility of some federal money to help pay for the building. By June 1935, in the heart of the Great Depression, West Hartford town officials clamored for a new Town Hall. Max Goldenthal, President (no Mayor until the 1950s) of the Town Council appointed a committee of three men to study allowing West Hartford to take advantage of money provided under a new grant plan of the Projects Works Administration (PWA). The town thought they could get 45% of the building costs paid by the federal government. Many Republican towns refused to take the federal money Many Republican towns refused to accept money from Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal programs, disagreeing with his premise that it was the role of the federal government to help out at the local level. In fact, once the building plan had been presented in October, Mr. Ludlow, the president of the town’s taxpayers’ association said “We are lending approval to the scheme of the New Deal. How can we Republicans accept this grant this year and then next year oppose the administration?” But Ludlow’s ideas were in the minority and the town went ahead with plans for the new town hall. Chosen to present the project to the town was Councilmen D. Hayes Murphy, President of Wiremold, and Dennis Ahern, a local builder. At the well-attended public hearing, Louis N. Denniston, representing the West Hartford Chamber of Commerce, gave a brief history of the present town hall, which was the remade third building of the First Congregational Church, situated on the northwest corner of Farmington and North Main and presently the site of of our peace memorial. Controversy had raged over the inadequacy and safety hazards in the building for years. Denniston argued that the present building was unsafe. West Hartford, he argued, was one of the wealthiest communities in the country for its size. He believed it should have “a building in harmony with its position.” By October 23, 1935, the Town Council approved building the new Town Hall and hired architects to draw a plan. The federal government wanted things to move quickly and the Council agreed that there wasn’t time to have competitive bids between architects. On October 29, the Council voted to accept the $141,300 grant from the PWA. Total cost of the project was about $314,000, which included $100,000 for buying the land from the First Congregational Church that lay just south of the church. The plan had to be in place by December. Only six months elapsed from the idea to breaking ground on December 10. The federal government, to help get more men back to work during the Depression, pushed this speedy timetable. When the building opened 13 months later, the federal reports showed that the project had employed a total of 635 men. A daily average of 185 men from the building trades and allied industries were employed for about eight months. At least 460 men gained employment off-site to provide materials for the building. The federal government funded 40% of the cost of five town halls in Connecticut by 1937 for a total of $1,000,000. The building process went smoothly, but the plans hit a temporary snag when, in October, a group of townspeople protested the felling of ten old maples in front of the almost-completed South Main Street building. The street, town officials said, had to be widened. David J. Raynsford, a 90 year old resident, said “Folks out here do about as they like,” as he protested taking the trees down. He said, “Those trees are over a hundred – it took a lot of time for them to grow. And now they’re turning them into cord-wood. It isn’t right.” Though these protesters may have supported the building, they balked at what they saw as destroying the environment. Mrs. Roy D. Bassette, secretary of the West Hartford Garden Club wanted an injunction to stop the cutting. She started protesting a week before, but not enough people came to her aid for legal action. Town Manager Rodney L. Loomis said that the trees would be made into stove wood and would be distributed to people cared for by the Welfare Department. This building, according to the townspeople, represented the messiness democracy. At the dedication of the building, U.S. District Attorney Robert P. Butler, alluding to political events in Europe, said: May this building which we here dedicate, be the spiritual as well as the physical temple of constitutional self-government… The sovereignty of man will sometimes be denied, his rights of free self-government will sometimes be surrendered as we have seen them denied and surrendered before our very eyes these past few years. But make no mistake, these things are only temporary. Sooner or later the deceived and deluded peoples will reclaim their heritage. The right of democratic self-government cannot be wholly destroyed. Getting rid of the old town hall ended up as one of those messy decisions about which many people had a say. One of the selling points of the town hall project was that the town could sell the site of the old town hall on the northwest corner of Farmington and South Main to get money to pay against the cost of the new building. But, in true democratic fashion, where sovereignty lies with the people, voters voted in a 1937 referendum not to sell the property or the buildings. But, by 1939, two years after the opening of the Town Hall, the three buildings on the site – the old Town Hall (built in 1835), its brick annex, and the old library still stood vacant. The old Town Hall was in such bad shape that most people felt it was unsafe to occupy. But others believed it was a historical building worth saving. Mrs. Bassette, the woman who wanted to save the trees, also wanted to save the building. In a letter to the Town Council she wrote: Symbolically the old Town Hall is more than just a bit of architecture occupying a valuable piece of land. It is the roots of our community, and together with all town halls throughout the country it is the roots of America. Such a thing should not be destroyed for a comparatively small amount of money, when many times that amount would never pay for the historical and spiritual value of this building. In January 1942, the Chamber of Commerce President proposed that the abandoned buildings be set up as an emergency hospital to care for the injured in case of an air raid. The building was never used as an emergency hospital, but was used as a billet for quartermaster troops assigned to the Farmington Avenue Armory and as an examining station by the Selective Service during the war. In 1947, the town tried to sell the property and claimed, in the real estate boom, that they had bids of up to $175,000 for the land. One bid was from Best &amp; Co. department store wanting to build a suburban store. Town Council candidates in the 1947 election made a campaign issue out of the land, hoping that the proceeds could be used to build a veterans hall. Another town referendum, this one on April 8, 1947 allowed townspeople to vote. Various town groups weighed in on selling the property, but the townspeople voted 2 to 1 to save the land and the buildings. In June, the council voted for funds to demolish the brick annex and it was knocked down by the end of the summer. In 1956, the old Town Hall still stood vacant, 19 years after the new town hall opened. Attempts to put it to use were prohibitively expensive and the building was an eyesore. But the local government was not sure how long the 1947 referendum bound them to keep the land. Finally on March 27, 1957 the Council ordered the building to be razed. The site became a park and the stone benches were made from the old church steps. It was reported “it is significant to note that West Hartford has taken the leadership in providing a small park within a high commercial district.” The town moved quickly to get the new Town Hall built, but agonized over the old town hall building because of what it symbolized – not so much for the value of the building. We can still identify with the power of these symbols and the importance of a democratic process, no matter how messy. West Hartford Art League Adapted from a talk delivered at the West Hartford Art League, April 9, 2016 In 1933, two artists organized the West Hartford Art Center to provide instruction in painting, drawing, sculpture, oil, pastel, watercolor, terra cotta and linoleum. Housed on the second floor of a vacant school building at 14 North Main, both children and adults flocked to the Center to hone their skills in rooms set aside for artists. The Center grew out of the friendship between artists Gertrude Patterson (1882-1952) and Rebecca Field (1905-2002) who shared a studio in the old school building. From the instructional Art Center, grew the idea of an art league to bring together West Hartford people interested in various aspects of art in an organization that would give the community a center for art activities. The West Hartford group modeled their organization after successful art leagues in Springfield and New Britain. The West Hartford Art Center became the West Hartford Art League (WHAL) in 1934 and, originally, the old Center School provided an ideal place for creative expression. Their space included a stage for modeling, large windows facing south and lilac trees and woodbine out the windows. Those who became members got to use the studios, received free instruction weekly in drawing and painting, could exhibit their art, and could attend functions including lectures, social gatherings, and exhibitions. The League wanted to stimulate interest in art in West Hartford and the vicinity. The League held an art appreciation discussion group every Wednesday night. In 1934, when the Picasso Exhibit came to the Avery Memorial at the Wadsworth Atheneum it was the first major retrospective of his work in the United States. The WHAL sponsored a talk and discussion on Picasso’s work both for those in the League and those in the community. But, the artists shared the Center School with dancers and singers and they yearned for a space of their own. When Sedgwick School was completed in 1931, the West District School closed, and this building became an possibility for the WHAL. In 1935, the president of the Art League went to Town Manager Rodney Loomis to request larger quarters for the growing art group. Loomis recognized the space issues of the league, and offered them the building. League members felt its central location trumped the problems with the building. It had no plumbing or central heating and only a wood stove. Members had to carry water in pails from a neighbor’s house before holding their spring exhibition and tea party in 1935. The League had to raise money, and they made it fun. They held teas and fundraisers to fund a furnace. By 1939 they raised enough money to build a kiln. They hired Simon Kelsey, a well known pottery artist, to conduct classes in pottery making. Gertrude Hough Patterson and Rebecca Field met at the Art Center and partnered to found this organization and make it work. They were of different generations, Patterson at 50 and Field at 27 when they founded the organization. But they both felt that there was more to the art world than making their art and teaching students. While they started by giving art lessons, they soon realized they wanted an organization for the community of people who loved, appreciated and lived their art. And Field and Patterson helped draw people to the League. Patterson worked in oil and pastel, as a portrait and landscape painter. She studied at the Norwich Art School, the Yale School of Fine Arts, the Eric Pope School, the Chicago Institute, and the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts. She taught at the Norwich Art School, Norwich Free Academy, in private schools and at Mount Holyoke College. One of her portraits hangs now at the WHAL. Rebecca Field studied at the Mass College of Art in Boston and then, in the late 1920s for two years in Munich, Germany. On her return, she settled in Hartford and taught for 40 years at the WHAL. She often exhibited her watercolors, sculpture, prints and miniatures at the League building. Her sculptures, according to a catalogue of works done under the aegis of the Federal Arts Project, are largely female figures and heads of women students done in plaster and bronze and ranged from realism to decorative in purpose. Field also used watercolors to paint landscapes and marine scenes. She painted scenes from the Berkshires and Grand Manan Island off of the Maine coast, as well as scenes from her travels in Germany, Scotland and England. Rebecca Field Jones celebrated 50 years with the West Hartford Art League in 1994. She stands with her sculpture which the League still displays, and may be a self-portrait. Source: West Hartford Art League. Patterson and Field’s organization was actually buoyed by its start in 1933 during the Great Depression. The federal government funded for many artists. When Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in 1933, he felt the federal government’s job was to help get the economy out of the depression by employing people in public works. Artists benefited from his relief measure to employ artists and artisans to create murals, easel paintings, sculpture, graphic art, posters, photography, theatre scenic design, and arts and crafts. The first federal money came to the town through the Federal Emergency Relief Agency (FERA, 1933-35). Field worked with children in the West Hartford grade schools on an FERA project to provide instruction for the more talented pupils. She wanted them to have special art training instead of being slowed by instruction in classes where both talented and non-inspired pupils were subject to the same teaching. The FERA was replaced by the WPA and its Federal Art Project (FAP) in 1935 as the feds continued to think that employing people was the right thing to do. The WHAL found a way into the Federal Art Project (1935-1943) money. Though it did have a cultural impact, its main purpose was to get artists producing public art and to document American design. Artists created over 200,000 works, among them, some of the most significant pieces of public art in the country. Connecticut artists produced over 5,000 pieces of art including 107 murals, many of which still exist. In West Hartford, Rebecca Field sculpted a bas-relief of William Hall for Hall High. As a WPA artist, she painted 39 works listed in the WPA inventory. In 1935, she painted a cultural and historical pictorial map of West Hartford for Connecticut’s Tercentenary Committee with FERA money. She included ten former citizens who were prominent in West Hartford history. Artist Walter Korder, also an active member of the WHAL, got paid $23.60 per week to paint murals at Charter Oak School and the old Hall High, now the Town Hall. The town only had to pay for materials. By 1940, The West Hartford Art League was one of fastest growing organizations in town. Founded as a place where artists could meet, learn and become inspired, the organization built a community of artists and patrons and an appreciation for art carried on in the schools and by this organization today. While federal, state and local government has helped the League survive, continued public funding is needed for the organization and the arts to prosper. Governor Robert Hurley Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, August 2011 On April 9, 1942, a caravan of 30 cars drove by 99 Outlook Avenue, jubilant in the Republican Town Council sweep of the local elections. 99 Outlook was the home of Connecticut’s Governor at the time: Robert A. Hurley. A Democrat, Hurley was likely not amused by the makeshift parade of cars. Robert and Evelyn Hurley moved to West Hartford from Bridgeport in 1937 when he was appointed Commissioner of Public Works. Robert Hurley (1895-1968) was born to Irish immigrants, attended Cheshire Academy and studied engineering at Lehigh University. He worked as a hod (brick) carrier to support himself at Lehigh. He was a four-sport athlete, starring in football and baseball; he played professionally in both sports after a stint in the US Navy on submarines during World War I. He then started a construction company in his hometown and in 1925, at age 30, he married a Bridgeport native, Evelyn Hedberg, a nurse. They had a son and two daughters. Hurley got involved in state government, in 1935, when he was 40 during the Great Depression when he served as the director of Fairfield County’s Works Progress Administration (WPA). When the 1936 Flood hit, then Democratic Governor Wilbur Cross named Hurley a special representative to coordinate relief activities between Hartford and the federal government. He then stepped up to coordinate the WPA for the entire state. Hurley was an “ardent supporter” of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and a big supporter of the New Deal. When Governor Cross appointed Hurley as Connecticut’s first Public Works Commissioner in 1937, Hurley moved to Outlook Avenue in West Hartford. Hurley stepped into a hornet’s nest in state government. Cross wanted him to oversee road planning, construction and repairs, while others believed that the Commissioner of the State Highway Department should be in charge. Cross believed the Highway Department was in cahoots with real estate agents employed by the State Highway Department who were benefiting by purchasing land along the planned route for the Merritt Parkway. Hurley issued a report that was damning towards the Highway Commissioner and the report called for the Commissioner to resign. Hurley used his record as Commissioner of Public Works to run for Governor. He seemed to run on Roosevelt’s coattails. The sitting Governor at the time was Republican Raymond Baldwin who had defeated the Democrat Cross in 1939. Hurley defeated Cross in the Democratic Convention and went on to defeat the incumbent Republican Governor by almost 14,000 votes. Hurley was only the fourth Democratic Governor out of 25 Governors in the previous 56 years. He was, as the Hartford Courant reported, “West Hartford’s leading Democrat,” who represented the New Deal Democrats that West Hartford Republicans wanted to taunt. Hurley served for one term. He introduced programs that helped both workers and the unemployed. He helped electrify some rural areas of Connecticut. He established Bradley Field as an airport and pushed the state to prepare for war. He developed “Connecticut’s Compact for Victory” pledging that all of Connecticut’s resources and industrial might and skills and energies of workers would be used in service to the U.S. When Hurley became Governor, he appointed several men from West Hartford to fill out his administration. He re-appointed Dr. Stanley H. Osborn as Commissioner of Public Health. He appointed West Hartford’s George L. Burke to be the new Commissioner of Public Works, the position Hurley held when he became Governor. Hurley also seemed to be an integral part of town life based on his speaking engagements in 1941, his first year in office. In April 1941, the West Hartford Grange gave Governor Hurley and his wife Evelyn the third and fourth degrees at a ceremony at the Masonic Hall on South Main Street. Hurley spoke as if the U.S. were on a war footing, saying “the Grange must continue to live up to its ideals, but if we are to continue down the path of democracy we must crush out the rule head of intolerance… Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty and American would rather die than give it up.” In May 1941, Governor Hurley broke ground for the foundation of the Noah Webster Memorial Statue. About 60 people gathered to hear the Governor honor Webster as “the town’s most famous citizen.” A WPA band sang Auld Lang Syne, and Korszak Ziolkowski, the sculptor, was the master of ceremonies. Later on in the month, Hurley spoke before one of the largest Memorial Day crowds in the town’s history. He gave his speech at the North Green Cemetery and spoke about the war in Europe. He said that the U.S. had warned the Axis: “an attack upon any base which may endanger the integrity of the Western Hemisphere will be resisted with force.” He spoke about fighting for freedom of religion, speech, press and assembly to stop the totalitarian state which took away citizen rights, and against governments that had the ability to “intern us in concentration camps and inflict upon us the cruelest tortures which were ever devised.” On June 13, 1941, Governor Hurley gave the commencement address at St. Joseph College when 49 young women graduated. Hurley again spoke of the war saying “We must not try to escape the consequences of the wrath of a Hitler, a Mussolini, a Stalin or any of those who follow their bloody emblems… we must not seek comfort by hiding from reality.” He claimed “women’s education plays a vital part in this world” emphasizing “those human values upon which society depends for its very life.” Hurley ran for reelection in 1942, but lost to former Governor Baldwin by 26,000 votes, the man he had defeated just two years before. Baldwin proceeded to abolish the State Department of Public Works, which had led to Hurley’s political success. In 1944, Hurley won the Democratic nomination for Governor, but lost to Baldwin, again by 26,000 votes, even though it was a presidential year in which FDR won his fourth term. Hurley retired from politics, and allowed the Democratic Party to unite after it had split into factions. In December 1944, the federal government appointed Hurley to the Surplus Property Disposal Board. He was confirmed by the Senate and he flew to Washington DC to take up his duties. Hurley retired from government work and became vice president of the Narragansett Machine Company in Rhode Island, but continued to live in West Hartford. Hurley Hall at the University of Connecticut is named after him. In 1947, Hurley headed a manufacturing company that made silver and stainless steel ware called the Old Colony Silver Company. If you go to Fairview Cemetery, in section 9 in the southwest section, you can see the Hurley headstone in the second row up a slight hill. You would never know that Hurley had been Governor. The nondescript moss covered stone reads Beloved Husband Robert A. Hurley, His Beloved Wife Evelyn L. Hurley, Father and Mother of Joan, Robert &amp; Sally. The stone does not tell that Robert A. Hurley was Connecticut’s first Roman Catholic Governor when he served from 1941-43. Historic Homes: Developing a Sense of Community Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, September 2005 In our fast-moving world, the permanence of our architecture inspires us to discover our sense of place. By observing houses in town, we can gain a better sense of our cultural roots, the history of the town and our human-made environment. Homes are prized by the families who live in them; visiting them can provide us a direct connection to the past. The Noah Webster House’s first historic house tour on September 17, 2005 will give us that chance. Five homes in the south end of town will be open to the public, three built in the colonial period, one in 1847 and one in 1900. Each provides a glimpse into the history of the town, the craftsmanship of architectural detail, and daily life in another time and place. The first two houses on the tour are owned by the town: the Sarah Whitman Hooker House at 1237 New Britain Avenue, built in 1735, and the Noah Webster House and West Hartford Historical Society at 227 South Main Street, built in 1747. The Sarah Whitman Hooker House was originally built in the 1720s and served both as a tavern and residence in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. The house has been renovated several times and its restoration in the last 30 years reflects the lives of those who lived inside. Recently the house has been in the news with the naming of the new middle school after an enslaved man Bristow who bought his freedom in 1775 from the owners of the house, Thomas Hart and Sarah Whitman Hooker. Hooker’s house was also used as a prison for Tories during the American Revolution. In 1807 Sarah Whitman Hooker added on to the house and the changes were made in the Georgian style of architecture. The central chimney was taken out and two chimneys were put in, producing a central hallway with two rooms on each side. The roof was rebuilt to add a full second floor. This house has been restored to a time period in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. On the house tour, you will be invited into the first floor. The Noah Webster House is restored to the year 1774 and represents a classic two-over-two colonial saltbox. In the 18th century the Websters owned 80 acres of land stretching west down the hill from Main Street. Though only a few of the present furnishings actually belonged to Noah, the house has period furniture which shows the difference in lifestyle 230 years ago. In this house, compare the “new” lean-to kitchen and fireplace from the late 18th century, which was built to save on wood and heat, to the original. Notice how the furniture is moveable and how rooms served more and different purposes than they do today. The new reproduction kitchen allows the museum to continue to be a hands-on museum without further endangering the original house. The third house, and one of the three private homes to be opened, is the Benjamin Colton House at 25 Sedgwick Road, built in 1769. This was built by the son of the second minister of the West Division. Reverend Colton was the minister of the first church in the West Division from 1713-1759. His first son George and grandsons Chester and George became ministers in other Connecticut towns. In the early 20th century, the Scarboroughs lived in the house. Clarence Scarborough served in World War I and kept the salutation “colonel” throughout his life. Note the setting of the house and imagine how the number of houses and farmland changed, particularly in the early 20th century. Residents of this home led the opposition to the building of the proposed Frank Lloyd Wright Theater on the corner of South Main Street and Sedgwick Road in the early 1950s. The fourth house is the Buckley-Coffing House, 272 South Main Street, built in 1847. It has 11 rooms, six fireplaces and an eclectic architectural style. This house is one of the few remaining mid-19th century farmhouses in town. The town’s population of about 1,000 in 1774 grew to only about 1,200 in 1854; not that many houses were built in those 75 years. This is a vernacular farmhouse with elements of Greek Revival and Italianate style. George Buckley sold the house to Charles Coffing in 1863. Coffing’s son inherited the house two years later. The property was still run as a farm until it was subdivided in the 1930s and then Webster HIll School was built behind it in the late 1940s. The newest house on the tour is the Charles E. Beach House at 18 Brightwood Lane, built in 1900. In 1859 his father, Charles M. Beach, the owner of a chemical and dye company in Hartford, bought a piece of land on the northeast corner of New Britain Avenue and South Main Street. He added to the property and became a gentleman farmer, developing a herd of high-grade cows on his Vine Hill Farm. These cows produced some of the first sterilized baby’s milk. One of his sons, Charles E. Beach, managed the farm. Beach was a civil engineer who did all the surveying and engineering work for the town. Beach was elected to the board of selectmen and was elected as a Democratic representative to the General Assembly, possibly the first Democrat ever from the town. In 1902, Charles M. Beach built a shingle style 20-room house with three stories, multiple dormers, balconies and seven fireplaces. The first floor of the home, which will be open in the house tour, includes seven ornamental woods and remarkable wood craftsmanship. There are at most 20 shingle-style homes in town and this home has not been altered much from when it was built more than 100 years ago. You will notice two other Beach-built homes as you drive on Brightwood Lane. Look at the view into Hartford and imagine owning all four corners of New Britain Avenue and South Main, and the property down to South Quaker Lane, including Beachland Park. Sir Winston Churchill said “we shape our buildings and then our buildings shape us.” This local house tour is a chance to take a look not only at the physical structures and styles of the human-made environment, but it can also help us wonder how people more than 200 years ago lived their daily lives and developed their sense of community. The tour will run from noon to 4 p.m. and the cost is $20. Stop at all five houses or choose the ones you want to see. Refreshments will be served at the Noah Webster House. Wolcott School and Wolcott Park Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, December 2005 The pending Blue Back Square development has many townspeople worrying that the “character of the town” will change and somehow be lost. Some people think that the Board of Education building, the Town Hall from 1937 to 1989, should not be sold or changed because of its historic value. The story of the Wolcott Farm in the southwest section of town can give some insight into how the use of land has evolved with economic and technological change as land moved from the private to the public sector. Chester Francis owned 141 acres of land in the southwest corner of town, south of New Britain Avenue in the early 1800s. In 1882, Francis’s son Samuel inherited 50 of his 141 acres and lived there until 1899. He had lived in the area since before the Civil War and built a house there in 1861. It is this house which became the Wolcott farmhouse. In 1899, the Long family bought the property, and reports showed that Long developed a “model farm,” just as Charles Beach had developed in the property up the hill that is now partially Beachland Park. Long planted an orchard with apple, pear, cherry and quince trees. He planted one half acre of asparagus and had a huge vineyard out of which he made 2 to 3 hogsheads of wine per year. He had a small herd of cows and a least three teams of horses. In 1902, Long sold the farm to a dentist named Chapman who suffered economically during the Panic of 1907. Chapman hired Henry A. Wolcott to draw up plans for several large buildings on the property. Chapman could not pay Wolcott because of the economic downturn, and ended up selling Wolcott the farm for a small amount of money and the mortgage. In August, 1907, Wolcott moved from his house at 46 South Main where the present Town Hall is, to the farmhouse. Henry and his wife Annie built up a vegetable and egg business as a result of the Panic of 1907. There was very little building and Wolcott, a civil engineer, had to close down his Hartford office. Wolcott had made his living designing and supervising factory construction. He designed the West Hartford Armory among many other buildings. By 1910 he converted an upstairs room in the house to a drafting room and began again to make money surveying and designing buildings again. His office remained in his house. He served as Second Selectman for West Hartford in 1909 and served on various boards, including the Board of Education, until 1933. He represented West Hartford in the General Assembly for four years in the 1920s. The Wolcott Farm was never a large dairy farm, like Charles Beach’s Vine Hill. His son, Henry F. Wolcott remembered his father’s farm as having 4 or 5 cows, from which they got their own milk, cheese and butter. They raised one or two pigs and cured them in the smoke house. They had 40 to 50 chickens and sold eggs. Later on they had sheep as well. They grew corn, wheat, oats, rye, and vegetables. A wheat field stood where Wolcott School is today. Wolcott was most known for his vegetables. There are residents who still remember buying vegetables at his roadside stand which operated until 1966. Wolcott’s son, Henry F., remembered the game on the farm. Lloyd Bugbee, the Superintendent of Schools, used to hunt pheasant on the farm. The Wolcott children recalled shooting raccoons which caused havoc with the horses with their holes in the fields. Ruth Wolcott, Henry F.’s sister, remembered eating raccoon meat. She also remembered catching and cooking snapper, frogs and eel from the pond which is now behind the baseball field at the park. Ruth also remembered her father cutting ice out of the pond in the winter. They stored it in the lower barnyard beyond the cow barn. Like the Trout Brook Ice and Feed Company, they packed the ice in sawdust and it lasted through the summer to keep their ice boxes cool. In 1953, the Town of West Hartford bought the 50 acre Wolcott Farm for the purpose of building an elementary school. Elmwood School, built in 1928, the present Elmwood Community Center, and Duffy, which opened in 1952 were overcrowded. The Wolcotts sold the property with the understanding that Henry F. Wolcott’s wife Susan could remain in the homestead as long as she wanted. The school opened in April of 1957 after the students had done half-day sessions at Elmwood School from September. In 1967, when Susan died, the town went ahead with its plans to make the northern section of the Wolcott land into a park. The 28 acre park officially opened in 1972 with 300 townspeople attending the ceremony, ending with a municipal ball. Henry F. Wolcott believed his father would have been delighted by the park. He had always wanted it to be one. This piece of property, which was farmed for over 200 years, has served the town well in its last 50 as a school and last 30 as a park. In the 1950s, when 10 new schools were built, more public land was needed and the town was willing to give up some of its tax base for the public good. The suburban neighborhoods which surround the original farmland are symbolic of the rapid change from farm town to suburb. Wolcott’s name reminds us that it was but a generation ago that farms still existed here. How does a town keep in touch with its past and yet keep up with new needs and desires of its citizens? How can the government’s need to build an infrastructure, keep taxes reasonable, and the developers desire to make a profit be balanced in the 21st century and how does it differ from 1950s? These decisions are made over and over again by the town leaders, the citizens, and those business people who can alter the landscape, but only the citizens control the character of the town. Shelter from the Storm Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, December 2011 Conard High School’s transformation into a shelter from November 1 to 8, 2011, marshaled many town and social services to care for more than 350 people who visited the shelter daily. This unprecedented use of the school during the natural disaster caused by the early snowstorm made me wonder how the town dealt with the flood in 1955. West Hartford’s response to the ’55 flood got tangled up in World War II housing which the town had been trying to demolish for four years. The Lanham Act, passed in 1940, permitted the use of federal funds to build public housing for defense industry workers. The government shifted from building housing for the poor to building housing for war workers as war industries began to boom. As workers migrated to the cities to take factory jobs they needed places to live. The federal government made this part of the war effort, suspending traditional public housing construction but expediting the construction of war worker housing administered by local public housing authorities. West Hartford’s three war housing projects, Elmwood Acres (on Elmhurst Street) with 300 units, Oakwood Acres (where Kennedy Park is today) with 335 units, and South Quaker Terrace with 159 units, (on Quaker Lane near the National Guard) all opened between 1942 and 1943. Oakwood Acres and South Quaker Terrace had a total of 494 housing units. Elmwood Acres consisted of small single-family homes and duplexes that are still inhabited. According to the Lanham Act, when the war ended, the housing would be torn down. The Oakwood and Trout Brook Acres housing was built very quickly and was not meant to last. And, post-war, towns worried about the developments becoming low-income housing. Just two months after the war ended, the town appointed an Advisory Committee on the Disposition of War Housing. At its first meeting in December 1945 over 100 South Quaker Lane tenants sought aid from federal, state and local officials who told them they had to move to Oakwood Acres. A spokesman for 40 families at South Quaker Terrace said adult members of most of the families signed a petition that would be sent to Governor Baldwin, Senators McMahon and Hart, U.S. Representative Herman P. Koppelmann and Councilman Cassens. Among the residents were 11 veterans who felt that moving would be a hardship. Veterans found it difficult to rent, and their advocates argued that those in Trout Brook Acres had not been able to find rentals because of the acute housing shortage. The Town Council relented and did not tear down the housing projects. Then again in 1951, the town’s Advisory Committee for the Disposition of War Housing met at the Town Hall to map out a request to extend the life of West Hartford’s two temporary federal housing projects. The town scheduled both to be razed by the government in July 1952. Veterans groups continued to be concerned because they were not able to find housing. They asked the government to build permanent low-cost veterans housing, but until then, wanted the town to keep the World War II housing up. In 1953, once again the Federal Public Housing Administration tried to tear down the housing. But the West Hartford Housing Authority fought it using the power of US Senator William Purtell. At that time, the projects were full of tenants with 369 families on the waiting list. These projects were no small thing for the town. Almost 1,400 children lived there with over 700 school-aged children. The federal government gave another reprieve. By 1955, the housing was close to demolition with just 78 families still living there and 257 vacancies. Then in August 1955, storm Connie rained five inches and five days later hurricane Diane dropped 14 inches in 34 hours. The flooding began on August 19. On August 23, 1955, the West Hartford Housing Authority got permission to reopen the units in Oakwood Acres to house homeless families from Farmington and Unionville. Just five days later, 30 flood families moved in with 20 more families on the way. To be accepted into the housing project, all the evacuees needed was a letter from the Red Cross. While there were no residents left at South Quaker Terrace, the Hannon-Hatch Post took over one of their buildings as a base to arrange to receive and distribute furniture, stoves, and refrigerators. West Hartford welcomed the Unionville residents. On September 1, the Board of Education voted to admit the “children of refugee families” into local schools. By that time, there were 55 refugee families in the housing project with room for 250 more. Superintendent Edward Thorne thought that the town might have to hire more teachers at Charter Oak and Smith Schools to accommodate these new children. Thorne also reported on problems of our own as the flood had caused washouts at Talcott and Bugbee, and caused boiler room problems at Morley and Smith. A year after the flood, 15 of the flood families still lived at Oakwood Acres as the town moved to final demolition. Finally in January 1957, the last families moved out of Oakwood Acres and the town demolished the last 10 of 27 apartment buildings and the community building. In its 15 years of existence, a total of 2,803 families had lived there. During that time, according to the chair of the West Hartford Housing Authority, not one family had been evicted. In some quarters, West Hartford has a reputation for being exclusive; we do pride ourselves on taking care of our own community. But in these two natural disasters separated by 56 years, the town reached out to those beyond its borders. In 1955, West Hartford housed people from Farmington and Unionville, albeit in rickety housing scheduled to be torn down five years earlier. And in 2011, the town opened the doors of one of its high schools and drew people from surrounding communities as well as West Hartford. We should be proud of our commitment to help those in need. High Ledge Homes and Restrictive Covenants Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, June 2010. See expanded version in a book chapter, co-authored with Vianna Iorio and Jack Dougherty, in On The Line. West Hartford’s construction business boomed near the end of the Great Depression. Over 1,800 homes were built in town between 1937 and 1940, attracting city dwellers to the suburbs. But in at least one West Hartford neighborhood, the ability to buy one of these new homes depended on your race. On July 23, 1937, R. G. Bent and Company purchased the 47-acre Wooley Estate on South Main Street for $30,000. The property was bound by Trout Brook to the east, South Main Street to the west, and Beach’s Vine Hill Farm to the south and the Hanson property to the north. During the Depression, the area became more valuable as a real estate development than it was as farmland. Bent quickly hired land surveyors Osterling and Samuelsen to subdivide the land into 100 building lots across from Rockledge Golf Course. The first tract of land, that would become Bentwood and Ledgewood Roads, included eight house lots along South Main and eight along Webster Hill Boulevard. Between ten and twelve house lots ran along each side of the street for a total of 49 lots. The R.G. Bent Co. built 34 homes on the property in 1938 and 1939. Less than two years after purchase in March 1940, the Bent Company sold the land to High Ledge Homes and established an “Agreement Concerning Building Restrictions” which can be found in Manuscript Volume 152 in the land records at the West Hartford Town Hall. Edward Hammel, President of High Ledge Homes, bought the property, and submitted an “Agreement Concerning Building Restrictions.” The corporation wanted “to create a uniform plan of development” and it imposed nine restrictions on houses built on the property. Restriction (e) read: No persons of any race except the white race shall use or occupy any building on any lot except that this covenant shall not prevent occupancy by domestic servants of a different race employed by an owner or tenant. According to the Agreement, homeowners could prosecute any person “violating or attempting to violate any such covenant…” The document established what could be considered a democratic body in the neighborhood in that the majority of property owners could prosecute others for violations. They could also vote to end the restrictions in 25 years (1965) or the restrictions would automatically extend every 10 years. View the interactive map of restrictive covenants filed in West Hartford town records during the early 1940s. Source: On The Line. This restrictive covenant, based on race, is the first I have seen in writing in West Hartford. By word of mouth I had heard that in the 1930s and 1940s and into the 1950s, no Roman Catholics could live on Stoner Drive, the first street developed on “the mountain.” No Catholics could buy on Wood Pond or Sunset Farms or West Hill or Sunnyreach. According to another resident, the address of a house on the corner of Foxcroft Road and Fern Street was changed to Fern Street because no Jews were allowed on Foxcroft Rd. But how many of these restrictions actually appear in West Hartford in writing and on legal documents? They have been hard to find in writing. When and why do these restrictions come about and when do they end? My friend Professor Jack Dougherty of Trinity College is studying just this question in his book-in-progress, On the Line: How Schooling, Housing and Civil Rights shaped Hartford and its Suburbs. His research on Hartford, West Hartford, Bloomfield and Avon is a fascinating comparison of development in these four towns, all of which have different characters, in part dependent on these restrictive covenants. The right to have a restrictive covenant stems back to a Supreme Court case Corrigan v. Buckley decided in 1924. In 1921, after a neighborhood was built, white property owners in a District of Columbia neighborhood formed a white property owners association. The homeowners wrote a restrictive covenant that prevented the sale of property to African American citizens. But, when white owner Corrigan, within this neighborhood chose to sell her property to an African American, white neighbor Buckley brought suit to enforce the covenant and stop the sale of the house. The District of Columbia Federal Court upheld the covenant and the Supreme Court, in a 9-0 decision, affirmed the decision by refusing to hear the case because, Justice Edward T. Sanford argued, the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction in the case. Sanford argued that under the Fifth Amendment’s phrase that no person should “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law” limited the federal government, not individuals. The Thirteenth Amendment, he argued, did not protect individual rights of blacks. The Fourteenth Amendment referred to actions of the state, not of private individuals. The Supreme Court case, Corrigan v. Buckley reaffirmed the right of property owners to have restrictive covenants. This ruling allowed developers and neighborhoods to stop racial integration in housing. The 1917 case Buchanan v. Warley had opened the door to integration. In 1948, the Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kramer found the restrictive covenants to be valid between parties that agreed on them, but argued that they could not be enforced because that would constitute a discriminatory state action, which the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited. Private parties could voluntarily follow restrictive covenants, according to the ruling, but they could not seek judicial enforcement because that would mean the state would have to take action that would be discriminatory. The result of this case was that restrictive covenants remained in deeds, but were not enforceable. According to a West Hartford resident, when she bought her home in 1970, the real estate agent told her the restrictive covenant existed, but he properly reported that it could not be enforced. This restrictive covenant helps to explain the town’s public willingness to try to restrict African Americans from living in the war housing built during World War II on Oakwood Avenue, Quaker Lane, and Elmhurst Drive. West Hartford’s small African American population in 1950 was not just by chance. And attitudes about Caucasians and African Americans living side by side in the 1940s may not have been so different here than they were in the south. Note: Thank you to Mary Everett, who formerly lived on Ledgewood Road for bringing the restrictive covenant to my attention. Thank you to Jack Dougherty and Katie Campbell for finding the restrictive covenant at the Town Hall. Also see the website “Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project” at http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/covenants.htm for information on how Seattle has addressed restrictive covenants in their city. Anyone who knows of restrictive covenants in their deeds, most likely written in the 1920s, 1930s or 1940s, please contact me. "],

In 1941 in our town, men were signing up for the draft, factories were bulging with defense contracts, and local volunteers organized relief for those in war torn Britain. The economy and society were on a war footing before West Hartford’s Gordon Sterling was killed at Pearl Harbor. Once the United States declared war, those on the homefront responded. In 1941, West Hartford’s mobilization for World War II was built on the fear of being attacked, building armaments, and helping those whose lives were already being devastated by war. West Hartford residents mobilized quickly for the war. Since Germany’s invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, the U.S. economy began to manufacture munitions and war supplies for the British, to defend them from, as FDR called them, “the aggressors.” Congress authorized a fivefold increase in the defense budget from $2 billion to $10 billion in 1940. On September 25, 1940, FDR signed the first peacetime conscription law in United States History. This law required men between the ages of 21 and 35 to register with local draft boards. A maximum of 900,000 men were chosen through a lottery system and served for 12 months. Fifteen months later, Congress amended the law to include all men between 18 and 65. On January 6, 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered a State of the Union Address that beckoned Americans to prepare for war. In mid January 1941, the women of St. James Episcopal Church established a unit for British Relief to make layettes and children’s underwear to send to the British War Relief Society. The manager of the Park Road Department Store donated much of the raw materials needed to do the work. The women of the church set up to meet from 10 to 4 Monday to Friday. Women within the community helped out for the war effort before our country was officially at war. The Lend-Lease Act, March 11, 1941, formally ended the U.S. pretense of neutrality. Hitler responded by ordering German subs to attack US vessels and the S.S. Robin Moor was sunk in May 1941. But the U.S. did not decide to enter the war militarily. In 1941, the U.S. role was as an arsenal of democracy. On January 27, the War Department announced that West Hartford’s Pratt &amp; Whitney Division, Niles-Bement-Pond Company won a $44,000 war contract to make gauges for the war effort. This factory, built in 1940, manufactured precision gauges and machine tools already in high demand from the Allies. Employment grew from 2,500 in 1939 to 4,600 in 1941. The plant ran 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In April 1941, the federal government began the sale of war bonds. In May, the federal government built war housing in the South Meadows of Hartford and in East Hartford. In June, the United Service Organizations drive to raise $50,000 went over the top. In June, a congressional committee announced that Connecticut would need 50,000 more workers in six months to keep up with defense contracts. And U.S. Housing Authority Administrator who visited Hartford in June pushed to speed up defense housing construction. There was talk of building defense housing in West Hartford. With the attack on Pearl Harbor, West Hartford lost its first soldier in battle, Gordon T. Sterling. Sterling had been serving already for a year when he engaged in battle. From his plane he shot down one of six Japanese planes before his was shot down and he was killed. This attack spurred local residents to prepare for attacks on the mainland. Two days after the Japanese attack and Sterling’s death, the assistant secretary of the American Radio Relay League of West Hartford revealed that “tens of thousands of radio amateurs” were ready to assist in civilian defense of the West Coast. In the previous year, the league supplied the United States military forces with valuable radio operators, who had been trained by local leagues. By December 11, 18 women drivers and six suburban cars of the Hartford unit of the State Defense Council’s Women’s Motor Corps reported for duty at the State Armory. The women were under the command of Captain Mrs. Thomas Sergeant of West Hartford and served to transport guardsmen from armories to their assigned duties. The fear of attack was palpable. Three days after Pearl Harbor, concerned parents held a meeting at the Beachland Park Clubhouse to express their “great concern” over the proximity of Charter Oak School to Niles-Bement-Pond defense plant just ¼ mile away from the school across Flatbush Avenue. The parents proposed that students be transferred to the Elmwood School. Within a week, Superintendent Lloyd Bugbee had calmed down the parents so that they had voted “complete confidence” in the Board of Education concerning the policy for school children to remain in buildings in case of an air raid. Bugbee also provided sand bags for extinguishing firebombs for each school. At the same meeting more than 60 people volunteered to be air-raid wardens. They had to train at the air-raid warden school to be held at Hall High. West Hartford volunteers would man the air raid post in the Trinity College tower. Twenty residents enrolled in the auxiliary firemen’s training school. They feared that plants like Holo Krome, Jacob Chuck, and Niles Bement Pond making goods for the defense industry bombs would be targets and citizens needed to be ready to douse fires. These 20 residents and over 70 high school students learned how to control incendiary magnesium bombs, also known as firebombs. These bombs were used in night raids, where bombers could not see their targets, but the consequent fires caused destruction. Surely West Hartford residents had read about Germany’s bombing of London in 1940-41. Leaders in the Town Hall established a Volunteer Bureau and four days after Pearl Harbor, scores of people registered to help with first aid, home nursing, canteen, nutrition, motor corps, air raid warden, group leader, auxiliary fire and police service and demolition squad. Arthur N. Rutherford, the head of the town’s building department led the town’s demolition team. He sent letters to over 300 builders and contractors and in a month he had mobilized plumbers, oil burner mechanics, electricians, carpenters, and other skilled tradesmen. He organized the town into four areas with 36 sectors to help rebuild in case the town was bombed. Rutherford also surveyed local schools to recommend buildings that would be suitable for air raid shelters. By January 18, 1942, builders and contractors pledged 250 vehicles for defense use. More than 600 emergency workers volunteered to work with the Defense unit to be ready to demolish buildings if they were bombed. This Memorial Day 2011, the parade committee is honoring veterans from World War II. The youngest veterans, now in their mid 80s will be honored during the parade and in the program. As our veterans are recognized on Memorial Day, we should also remember the sacrifices made by those left on the homefront who supported those who fought the battles. The Vanguard of America Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, February 2001 West Hartford Public Schools ranked number one among peer municipalities!! West Hartford Public Library ranked number one in Connecticut!! An award-winning calendar displaying our parks!! The highest voter turnout among peer municipalities for the 2000 election!! Superlatives abound in West Hartford. Mayor Rob Bouvier, in his the state of the town speech in 2001, regaled the town with its accomplishments – which are not just the result of one year’s work, but are part of a long history of the town being at the forefront of serving its citizens. West Hartford has never been shy about selling itself to the world. Today we have banners around town touting our accomplishments. In 1940, the Chamber of Commerce proclaimed in a 16-page booklet called Vanguard of America: A Small Town that Grew Up, that read: West Hartford can rightfully claim position among those communities that are the highest fulfillment of the dreams and decisions, heartaches and toil that founded America. What type of a community were we in 1940 and how did the Chamber of Commerce portray us? When the pamphlet was written, the country and the town were just starting to make their way out of the Great Depression. Many residents suffered during the economic downturn, but the town as a whole grew. The population in 1930 was about 25,000 and reached 44,000 by 1940, a growth of 76 percent. Architects designed houses with 1½ baths, attached garages, and architectural detail that attracted urban dwellers to the growing suburb. Many of these houses appeared in national magazines as examples of houses with charm and appeal for the middle class life. The Chamber of Commerce claimed that we were a vanguard because of our political system. West Hartford was the first town in Connecticut to adopt the council-manager system of government in 1919. We were the first town in Connecticut to have a planning commission that established zoning laws in the mid 1920s. We were the first town in the state to have the unit system of realty appraisal that “meant equitable taxation for rich or poor, merchant or industrialist.” This political organization provided a means to run the town by experts, not politicians. Probably because of the Town Manager, Republican West Hartford readily took advantage of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal programs including the Public Works Administration. This program, established to provide work for the unemployed and to build public works, funded 45% of the Town Hall and Library built in the mid-1930s. In 1940, the Chamber of Commerce claimed that West Hartford had the largest per capita income tax of any town in the United States and the lowest welfare percentage in the state. The pamphlet claimed that West Hartford’s schools were “among the finest schools, public or private, in the United States.” A survey of 200 secondary schools, including private schools, completed by the Cooperative Study of Secondary School Standards in Washington, D.C. rated Hall High among the top ten of the 200 surveyed. And yet, the Chamber of Commerce boasted that the town was economical in its school spending. We were 132nd out of 169 towns in percentage of income spent on schools. We were 51st in the amount spent per pupil. In 1940, the town was proud that 45% of its students went to college. And it was proud of the type of education students got in the town: one that made citizens of a democracy understand their freedom and use it for good purpose. By 2000, the public high schools boasted that over 90% of their students went on to college, a sign of both the need for a college education in the work world and the growth in the number of colleges available. American Government, a required course in both the town and the state, continues to teach students how to be good citizens. The Chamber was also proud of the houses of worship here in 1940. There were a total of twelve: two Congregational, two Baptist, two Roman Catholic, two Episcopal, a Swedish Methodist, a Swedish Lutheran, a Universalist, and one synagogue. The Chamber believed that this showed a commitment to religious liberty, one of the foundations of democracy. In 2000 in West Hartford, with a population which grew 50% since 1940, there were 37 houses of worship including five Congregational, four Baptist, seven Roman Catholic, two Episcopal, one Lutheran, a Unitarian Universalist, and nine others and eight Jewish houses of worship split between one Reform, two Conservative and five Orthodox. The Chinese Baptist Church, a Society of Friends, a Spanish Pentecostal Church and a Jehovah’s Witness underline the increasing diversity of the town in the 21st century. The town was one of the first in Connecticut to hire a recreation director. In 1940, the town already boasted three parks: Beachland, Fern and Elizabeth. In 1940, the “Fern Street playfield” had a large swimming pool, a small children’s wading pool, nine lawn tennis courts, paddle tennis courts, horseshoe courts, a softball diamond, a picnic grove with benches, and fireplaces and playground apparatus. At Beachland Park, residents could sail boats in the summer and ice skate in the winter. They also had paddle tennis and horseshoe courts. Since then, the town has added Eisenhower, Kennedy, Wolcott, Westmoor, and Spice Bush Swamp to its parkland. The Chamber of Commerce tried to attract businesses as well as residents to the town. In the last section of their pamphlet, they encouraged “modern business executives” to consider the town as a site for their business. They stressed that land was available, schools were good, and the political structure of the town led to equitable tax rates. Economic planners today continue to try to lure businesses to the town with all the same arguments except that there is little open land left in the town. What is the basis for all these superlatives about our town? Those who have lived here for a while experience the pride that people have in West Hartford and for good reason. West Hartford’s citizens are proud of the democracy in which they live, appreciate the services the town offers, and take advantage of the opportunities available. They believe, like the Chamber of Commerce did in 1940 on the eve of America’s entrance into World War II, that: We are only one rather small American town, but we know that we can continue to find within our experience and under our flag the means for nobler and more joyful lives. Korczak Ziolkowski and Chief Standing Bear Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, July 2013 In June 2013, Conard High School Senior Emma Briggs travelled with Hawkwing to work on the Cheyenne River Reservation. She travelled to Thunderhead Mountain in the Black Hills of South Dakota to view the Crazy Horse monument. There, in the museum, to her surprise, she found this label under a photograph of Korczak Ziolkowski (1908-1982) and Chief Henry Standing Bear: Ziolkowski is well known in West Hartford as the sculptor of the Noah Webster statue, completed in 1941. At age 32, Ziolkowski sculpted Webster as a monument for the town. Before he entered World War II in 1943, Ziolkowski met Chief Henry Standing Bear to plan sculpting Crazy Horse into the Black Hills as a poignant counterpoint to Mt. Rushmore (1927-41). The US government sent Chief Henry Standing Bear, born in South Dakota, to the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania to forcibly assimilate him into white culture. He liked learning English and the ways of white people but used this knowledge to stand up for his culture. He fought with his pen, writing letters to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, trying to assure Indians land ownership. In 1927, he ceremoniously inducted Calvin Coolidge into his Sioux tribe as “Leading Eagle.” Though he spent some time working on Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show, his focus in later life was Indian history and the Crazy Horse statue. In 1939, Ziolkowski, at age 21, went west to help noted sculptor Gutzum Borglum sculpt Mt. Rushmore. Standing Bear asked Borglum to add Crazy Horse to Mt. Rushmore, but Borglum turned him down. Ziolkowski and Standing Bear must have met on that visit, because in 1939 Standing Bear sent a letter to Ziolkowski asking him to go out to Pine Ridge, South Dakota where they met for three weeks. There, Ziolkowski learned about the traditional Indian way of life. Ziolkowski remembered: “Standing Bear grew very angry when he spoke of the broken treaty of 1868. That was the one I’d read about in which the President [Andrew Johnson] promised the Black Hills would belong to the Indians forever. I remember how his old eyes flashed out of that dark mahogany face, then he would shake his head and fall silent for a long while.” Originally Standing Bear believed that the entire Crazy Horse project had to be completed by Indians, but there were no Indian sculptors. Ziolkowski stepped in. In early May, 1943, Chief Standing Bear (1874-1953) traveled to West Hartford and stayed with Ziolkowski at 216 Sedgwick Road, the house with the turret as Sedgwick turns into Mountain Road near the West Hartford Art League. Standing Bear had two objectives on his speaking tour: he wanted to interpret the little known ceremonies and customs of his people to eastern audiences. And he wanted to firm up plans with Ziolkowski so that he could convince officials in Washington D.C. that he should sculpt his cousin Crazy Horse out of the Black Hills. Ziolkowski planned two public appearances for Standing Bear. On Friday, May 7, 1943, the Chief spoke at the Annual Sedgwick Boy Scouts Parents Night sponsored by the Boy Scouts and the West Hartford Police Department. In his talk he said he was on his way to Washington D.C. to “promote a greater degree of understanding and cooperation between the two races.” Standing Bear claimed, “the Indian understands the white man as the white man has never learned to understand the Indian.” Ziolkowski also planned for him to perform on Sunday afternoon May 16 at 3:00 at the Hall High School Auditorium in the center of town. He was to appear in full ceremonial dress under the auspices of the Noah Webster Fife and Drum Corps. Townspeople needed to get tickets to get in. Ziolkowski recorded a hitherto unknown ancient chieftains song for folklore collections. Standing Bear described in detail the ceremony followed in making a tribal chieftain. Preceding the presentation, Ziolkowski scheduled the Noah Webster Fife and Drum Corps to play a concert on the green along with the Mattatuck Drum Band of Waterbury playing military pieces at 2:45. The bands and Boy and Girl Scouts planned to parade to Hall with the Chief in full regalia. His second reason was to confer with Korczak Ziolkowski before he went into the armed forces about the prospective Crazy Horse Memorial to be carved by the sculptor out of one of the granite hills of South Dakota which Crazy Horse defended so valiantly. Standing Bear and his fellow chiefs’ dream since the late 1930s would hopefully come to fruition at the end of the war. In his 1943 visit to Washington, Standing Bear did not get approval for the monument. Harold Ickes, Secretary of the Interior, proclaimed “I will not have my mountains defaced.” Ziolkowski replied “Sir, I will not deface your mountain, my work will serve only to compliment nature.” Ickes carried the day. But Standing Bear and Ziolkowski continued their work. Ziolkowski built a model out of 300 pounds of Tennessee marble, working at a personal expense of $40,000. The war interrupted Ziolkowski’s work, but when he was discharged, he hadn’t lost the desire to work with Chief Standing Bear. In March 1946, Ziolkowski traveled to Washington where he again tried to convince government officials in the Office of Indian Affairs and Under Secretary of the Interior Oscar L. Chapman and this time, got their “moral backing.” Ziolkowski never took any government money for the project. On April 28, 1947, Ziolkowski left his West Hartford home at 5:30 a.m. with a five car caravan and a party of seven for the Black Hills to begin work on the 400 foot long and 300 foot tall sculpture of Crazy Horse on the 8,000 foot mountain. He had 4 ½ tons of tools and equipment and the blessings of his wife who would meet him in July after recovering from illness. He was joined by a family of four from Maine, a man from Burlington and Kenneth Farber, a 21 year old son of Max I. Farber, assistant managing editor of the Hartford Times. As he began his 2,000 mile trip, he did not know where his financial backing would come from, but he hoped tourists would contribute to support the project. His hope to build a museum from the used stone removed from the mountain to house the ancient treasures of the Sioux Indians has come true as witnessed by West Hartford’s Emma Briggs. But his dream to build an Indian University on the site has not yet come to fruition. As work on this monument moves into its 65th year, Ziolkowski’s family carries on the work to memorialize the courageous Indian leader who won in battle against the U.S. government. Ziolkowski’s project and his West Hartford connection live on. The Arsenal of Democracy Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, May 2002 At West Hartford’s May 1941 Memorial Day parade, Governor Robert A. Hurley, then a resident of 99 Outlook Avenue, declared: Those rights which we enjoy today of freedom of religion, speech, press and assembly can be lost, if we do not throw the full weight of our resources and manpower against the brute forces of totalitarianism, and in their place substitute a state which forbids individual worship; flings us into prison without trial; confiscates our property without compensation; inters us in concentration camps and inflict[s] upon us the most cruel tortures ever devised. . .The forces of world chaos are no less threatening to our security than were the elements of disunion in Lincoln’s day. We can survive only if we meet them with the same determination that he and the common people of his day did. Hurley’s interventionist rhetoric ran counter to U.S. public opinion. Nearly 90% of the population opposed entrance in an almost two-year-old European war. On the other hand, by May 1941, West Hartford’s economy already reaped the economic benefits of war, as we threw the “full weight of our resources and manpower” against the Axis. Pratt &amp; Whitney, a division of Niles-Bement-Pond, opened in 1940 on New Park Avenue, the site of Charter Oak Park, Luna Park and the Connecticut State Fairgrounds where Home Depot is today. Pratt &amp; Whitney Machine Tools manufactured precision gauges and machine tools already in high demand from the Allies. Pratt &amp; Whitney built on the Charter Oak Race Track property and opened this factory in 1940. By December 1940 the factory ran 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and a year later employed almost 5,000 workers. The six CIO unions helped keep morale up through the war effort. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. By December of 1940, 3,586 employees worked 24 hours a day six days a week in capacity operations, a year before the United States entered World War II. Wages increased 27% between 1939 and 1940 and were 15% higher than they were in 1929, before the Depression. Prosperity crept back into town as Connecticut continued its role as the “arsenal of democracy” during wartime. By December 17, 1941, just 10 days after Pearl Harbor, the workers at Pratt showed their unified support for the country’s war effort when they rallied at the plant. In a telegram sent to President Franklin Roosevelt, they said, “The employees of the Pratt &amp; Whitney Plant… 4,600 strong, are unanimous in their support of your program and wish to assure you of their 100 percent effort in increasing production of machine tools, small tools and gages so urgently needed.” According to President Clayton Burt, Pratt &amp; Whitney produced three times as much in 1941 as their peak output in 1929. The machinists’ union leader said “We must pledge ourselves for more production.We must pledge ourselves for the complete defeat of fascism and triumph for democracy.” From August 1940 to August 1942, the company expanded seven-fold. For this growth and production, the factory received the joint Army-Navy “E” flag won for excellence in war production. The federal War Production Board, trying to maximize war production, encouraged companies to establish management-labor committees in early 1942. The Hartford Times featured Pratt &amp; Whitney’s committee in an April 15, 1943 story. The committee, which included six CIO union men and six men from management, tried to increase production while maintaining a sane daily life for its workers. The committee dealt with a wide variety of problems including rationing, safety, and blood drives. One of the main tasks of the committee was communication. They put up some 175 bulletin boards and plastered them with posters to induce each worker to increase his personal efforts in speeding up production. Twelve large informational bulletin boards posted war news, war maps, nutritional diets to maintain health, and cartoons to boost productivity and encourage a positive attitude toward war work. The company instituted a suggestion box program. Pratt &amp; Whitney gave a minimum prize of $5 for each accepted suggestion with no top limit. Management awarded prizes totaling $2,775 for 240 suggestions that helped make the plant more productive. A subcommittee on worker transportation arranged carpools to save on gas and rubber. These committees also supervised war bond drives and Pratt never failed to go over the top on any of the drives. With a seven-day week and 12-hour days, it was difficult to keep workers at work and absenteeism was a big problem and a joint subcommittee addressed that issue. A safety committee helped to reduce the frequency of injuries, thus increasing production. Hiring of a medical director and staff to take care of illnesses and promptly treat small injuries proved successful in keeping production going and helping the workers. These joint management labor councils served to keep the lid on labor demands during the war. The local press and the federal government applauded production at Pratt and encouraged the joint union-management council through its War Production Board. However, it was an uneasy alliance. Workers and management believed what Governor Ray Baldwin pledged in his 1943 Memorial Day speech in West Hartford: “We must see that the materials and weapons needed are supplied to those who are fighting to maintain our liberty, who are beating down the forces of oppression and tyranny. We have a duty and a pledge to them.” But when the war ended, that common purpose no longer united them. Just seven months after the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the workers at Pratt &amp; Whitney went on strike to get their wages in line with production and inflation. The machinists struck for 20 weeks, from mid March until August 7. The company laid off over 4,500 workers from its peak production days to a low of 2,500. By the end of the strike, there were but 1,800 left at the factory. The Metropolitan News claimed the strike had “all the panoply of a ‘big league’ strike.” Workers were fined for picketing the homes of the business owners in town. Governor Baldwin’s words on Memorial Day in 1943 were somewhat prophetic. He said that the Germans had misjudged us believing that “because we are a nation of many tongues and many kindreds we would disintegrate readily. But, we are held together indissolubly by a common bond of love of liberty and freedom.” It was the common enemy in war that kept the Americans together. When the war ended, the “many tongues” spoke again for themselves, questioning personal sacrifices made in the war for the good of all. Workers in West Hartford, and around the country, spoke boldly for their individual and collective rights, which had been muted during the war. The federally imposed cooperation during the war improved life for workers only to an extent and when the forced cooperation imposed by the war emergency was lifted, the workers raised their voices once again. West Hartford Emigres: The Soviet Jewish Experience Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, March 2005 Zhenya Tseytlin, a West Hartford immigrant from Odessa on the Black Sea, was in the fifth grade when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union during World War II. The Germans and Romanians drove the Jewish people out of Odessa and took them to a camp where they were to be killed. In March, 1942, the occupiers took mothers and children out in a field to be shot. Zhenya’s mother told her to run. Zhenya said, “I was crying. I didn’t want to go, but some force pushed me out of that mass. I started running towards the woods. Alone!” Zhenya heard shots and screams. She kept running and found a pile of grass in which she hid for the night. The next day, 10 year old Zhenya wandered from village to village to find some help. She knocked on the door of a house in one village and a 24 year old woman with children took her in. Zhenya recounted, “I was starving… She was such a noble person… She didn’t ask if I was Jewish.” Zhenya stayed with the family for two years and her life was saved. This is just one of the stories of Soviet émigrés to the greater Hartford area recounted in “Witness to War, 1941-5: The Soviet Jewish Experience,” an exhibit at the Noah Webster House for several months this winter. Dr. Betty Hoffman, from St. Joseph College, interviewed forty Jewish men and women who survived World War II in the Soviet Union and many settled in West Hartford. This exhibit depicts how Jews, both those who served in the military and civilians, survived World War II. The Russian émigrés have stories to tell of survival in circumstances that were not as bad as those in Germany, but were stunningly depraved. Now on their retirement here in West Hartford, hoping for better lives for their children and grandchildren, these émigrés have memories that altered their lives dramatically. Many Jewish families who emigrated to West Hartford in the 1990s felt as though they would be treated more fairly in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution in 1917. As Russian citizens adapted to a new secular order, the practice of religion was outlawed. The idea of equality promised by a Communist state drew many Jews from other parts of Europe. At first, the ideal of equality helped the Jews, but by 1932, they had to carry around a Jewish designation and it was used to discriminate against them in education, employment, and housing. Most protected themselves by dropping behaviors which marked them as Jewish. When Hitler invaded the USSR in 1941, the Red Army retreated and Jews like Zhenya Tseytlin were at greater risk, but they were more able to survive than if they had been in Germany. The Jews were controlled by the Einsatzgruppen, sent in by the Germans as part of the Nazi invasion force, whose job was to get rid of what they considered to be undesirables. Jews were sent to ghettos, forced to work, and killed outright. The Einsatzgruppen murdered one million Jews between 1941 and 1942. At Babi Yar 30,000 were killed in two days in September 1941. Lida Prokopets, another Odessa resident, worked in a Jewish infirmary as a nursing aid when the war began and she worked through the 79 day siege of her city. The Germans and the Romanians occupied the city and looked for Communists and Jews. She remembered a hanging pole set up in each marketplace where Jews and Communists were publicly hung. Prokopets, a West Hartford resident who emigrated in the early 1990s, related that neighbors would not take them in because they were Jewish. They secretly moved to the shed in their backyard that had been used for firewood. Four members of her family stayed there. A woman in the neighborhood gave them food. One day a car arrived with Romanians who had come to find them. Her mother “took off her wedding ring and another ring she had hidden. She said “let us go,” gave them the rings, and we went to my sister.” In one more month, the police came and took them. Pokopets survived. Mark Aronov, another West Hartford resident, was a student at the Moscow Medical Institute when war broke out. Because there were so many casualties, Aronov, training to be a surgeon, became instead, a specialist in medical triage. Nina Aronov remembered fleeing town and traveling for two years. She lived in a village, and picked potatoes. She had no clothes. Her mother found a cotton bag, sewed it, and painted it to make her a skirt. Sometimes Jews were confined to ghettos where the occupiers killed the Jews systematically by starving them, from disease or exposure, or from outright brutality and murder. West Hartford resident Frima Leykikh, remembered how the commandant of the ghetto “used to come in and ask how many corpses were taken out that day. He was told four, five wagons. He stated that it was not enough. They had to take out more.” This exhibit is the brainchild of Dr. Hoffman and was funded by the Jewish Historical Society of Greater Hartford, the Connecticut Humanities Council, the Jewish Federation of Greater Hartford, and the Fisher Foundation. It originally opened two years ago at the Greater Hartford Jewish Community Center in West Hartford and has traveled as far as Nashville, Tennessee. Its opening at the Noah Webster House signals a new collaboration with the Noah Webster House and West Hartford Historical Society as they try to reach out to a wider public and make it known that they want to represent the history of all West Hartford residents. The history of West Hartford is also a compilation of the many stories of those who live in town. This exhibit will open your eyes to the breadth of experience, suffering and hope of an important segment of our population and its offspring. Recalling 140 Who Gave Their Lives During World War II Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, May 2005 Of the 225 total West Hartford war casualties, 140 of them died in World War II (1941-45). Two men died in 1941, six in 1942, 22 in 1943, 54 in 1944, 51 in 1945 and 4 in 1946. The 139 men and one woman who gave their lives in war, give us a chronology of World War II. Their family stories tell us who was left behind on the homefront. Here is a glimpse at 14 of the 140 service people who sacrificed their lives for their country.. West Hartford’s first casualty, Gordon Sterling, aged 22, died in the attack at Pearl Harbor. He was in the Air Force and was one of the only people to engage the Japanese. From his plane, he shot down one of six Japanese planes before his plane was downed and he was killed. The playing field behind Charter Oak School was dedicated in May 1943, and named after the first West Hartford casualty. It is now known as Sterling Field. Lt. Gordon Sterling (1919-1941) grew up on Argyle Avenue. His father worked at the Underwood Typewriter factory. Gordon was a Boy Scout. He, graduated from Hall High School and enrolled at Trinity College in 1937. He took private flying lessons, and in September 1940 he enlisted in the Army Air Corps. He died at Pearl Harbor. Used with permission from “Together We Served,” https://army.togetherweserved.com In March and October 1942, two men were killed in the Pacific, Lewis Davis who was missing in action south of Java and Adam Fahnestock in New Guinea. Fahnstock of Pilgrim Road was 32 at his death. He was a member of the Air Force. Davis, of Lincoln Avenue was 27 when he was reported missing in March 1942 but was not declared dead until December 1945. The first casualty in 1943 was in North Africa. The United States engaged the Italian African forces in 1942 and 1943. Two men, William G. Hale and James W. Hatch were both killed in plane crashes in January and April in North Africa. Army Air Force Second Lieutenant Hale of North Quaker Lane was 23 when his plane crashed. He left his wife of five months in West Hartford, and two older brothers in the service. Hatch, of Norwood Road, was 24 when his pursuit plane crashed in Tebourba, Tunisia in April 1943. Hatch was a graduate of the Kingswood School and Yale University. Hatch’s father was president of the Bush Manufacturing Company and had employed his son on his graduation in 1941. The VFW Hannon Hatch Post is named after him. After the allies defeated the North African armies, they invaded Sicily and then the mainland of Italy. Rodney MacGregor and James Hannon were killed in the Italian campaign. MacGregor, age 23, was the pilot of a troop transport plan that was shot down. Hannon, of 32 Vera Street, was killed in action in Italy in November 1943. He worked at Colt’s before he enlisted. He left his mother, a brother in the Air Force, and two sisters. (He is the other half of the Hannon-Hatch Post.) Seven more West Hartford men were killed in the assault on Italy. During World War II 140,000 women served with the Women’s Army Corps (WAC). The only woman casualty from West Hartford was Mary O’Dell, aged 27, a member of the WACs. She was employed at Aetna when she enlisted in early 1942 and probably performed clerical work in the service. O’Dell received her training at the Fort Des Moines Officer’s Candidate School. A graduate of Hall High, she left behind her parents at 82 Griswold Drive. In 1943, more men died in the Pacific islands: New Georgia Isle, Solomon Isle, Gilbert Isles, New Hebrides, and the Philippines. The men who died were in the Army, Air Force, and Marines. Lieutenant George J. Bolles, of 273 South Quaker Lane was West Hartford’s 30th casualty. According the Metropolitan West Hartford News, Bolles “heard the news of the Jap treachery at Pearl Harbor on Sunday December 7th and enlisted on Monday, December 8th.” He was killed after his B-24 Liberator had “inflicted heavy damage on enemy shipping” when his plane was returning to its base in New Guinea when the plane disappeared. The invasion of France at D-Day in June 1944 included many West Hartford men, 14 of whom were killed in that country from June to December. The first West Hartford man killed in France was Richard S. Kuehner, 749 Farmington Avenue, of the Air Force. He was killed “in action during the invasion of Normandy” after D-Day. He was a fighter pilot of a P-47 Thunderbolt. Radioman Wilbur Allen, aged 21 of 1478 Boulevard, was killed in his minesweeper on his way to the invasion of France. He had been employed by the Hartford Times and left his mother and two sisters. William J. Stone, age 20 of Edgemere Avenue, was killed in the Battle of the Bulge on November 15, 1944 in Belgium. Stone had been missing since September. His Golden Lion 106th infantry battalion held back the full weight of Germany’s Von Rundstedt’s breakthrough to give the Army command time to regroup. This battle was, according to the Metropolitan News, a “saga of courage seldom equaled.” It was the heaviest bombardment ever witnessed by the armed forces. Over 8000 men were either killed or captured in the Battle of the Bulge. Stone, who graduated from Talcott Junior High and completed two years at Hall, left his parents, a brother and three sisters. Frank J. Concatelli, aged 25, a private in the army was the first man to be killed in Germany. He was killed at Puffendorf on November 17, 1944. Concatelli was one of the first seven members of an armored division to enter Germany during the American invasion of Germany on September 18. He lived at 69 Hillcrest and left his parents and four brothers, two of whom were in the service, and two sisters. In the Pacific, many men were killed in the Philippines starting with Sanford Perkins, Jr. of the Navy on December 18, 1944. Six more men were killed on the island of Luzon in 1945. Perkins was part of a bombing squadron with the USS WASP, operating against enemy Japanese airfield in South Luzon. He braved relentless fire from the Japanese anti- aircraft guns. Perkins deployed his division of fighter bombers to “execute a vigorous and successful attack on the target fighting his plane boldly to score a direct hit on a large airfield building and repeatedly strafing hostile anti-aircraft positions. He was a graduate of Yale and the grandson of the former editor of the Hartford Times. He lived at 82 Van Buren Avenue and was a graduate of Yale University. The Carey brothers died in their plane over Indochina in 1945. They were inseparable, going to Loomis together and then Amherst College playing on the same football team. They each married a woman named Jeanne (and Jean) three days apart. They withdrew from college in 1940 and joined the army on the same day. They also died the same day as pilot and copilot. West Hartford streets, schools, parks and buildings are often named after local men and women who made a difference to the town. I wonder if veterans who walk into the Hannon-Hatch Post realize that these two men died in a World War II battle. How many soccer, football and softball players know that when they play at Sterling Field, it is in memory of the first West Hartford casualty from World War II? Town leaders who name these public places want people to remember the deeds of those who went before them, and in this case, people who gave their lives for a cause bigger than themselves. World War II Victory Gardens in West Hartford Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, January 2011. Sources included news article scrapbooks compiled by the Recreation Department from its inception in 1940, currently in possession of the author. It isn’t so much what the gardener gets out of the garden as what the garden does to the gardener. – Lloyd Bugbee February 1, 1943 Sustainability and eating local are the bywords of the 2010s. One might think we’d invented something new! We have much to learn from World War II Victory Garden Program run by West Hartford’s Recreation Department in the 1940s. When Japan bombed Hawaii on December 7, 1941, the United States went on war footing. The federal bureaucracy worked well in the 1930s to mobilize the economy and when war broke out, departments shifted to get the citizenry involved in the war effort. From 1942 to 1945, Victory Gardens produced more than 40% of all the vegetable produce consumed nationally. Nearly 20 million Americans planted these gardens in backyards and empty lots. This was almost 60% of households. Victory gardeners harvested an estimated 9 to 10 million tons of vegetables, an amount that equaled the value of all commercial production of fresh vegetables. The program played a key role in feeding Americans, but it also had an important psychological effect. It was a way for people to feel like they were doing their part on the homefront and a way to build community spirit. The Recreation Department wanted the Victory Gardens to be viewed not just as directly aiding the national defense. They were also important for developing the resourcefulness and initiative of those interested enough to make a reasonable effort. In April 1942, West Hartford’s Recreation Director Jacob Feldman appointed Mrs. Howard D. Wilcox of South Main Street to supervise the West Hartford Victory Garden program. She worked directly with landscape expert Peter J. Cascio of 2600 Albany Avenue who chaired the Victory Garden Campaign. Most volunteers came from the Little Garden Club and the West Hartford Garden Club. These volunteers supervised students in the Victory Garden program from Hall, Beach Park, Center, Charter Oak, East, Elmwood, Morley, Sedgwick Elementary and Seymour Schools. Wilcox recruited 50 volunteer leaders to supervise and inspect student gardens and neighborhood gardens. They helped solve gardening problems. Both Cascio and Wilcox were perplexed with how to supervise this many newly minted farmers, but the program went forward. They started by having students draw garden plans in early April. They established a timetable to have the gardens spaded by April 20. Wilcox and Cascio set up a rating system for each garden to be sure that food would be produced. They rated vegetable gardens on location, arrangement of rows, cultivation and care of the plants. For flower gardens, they considered landscaping, neatness, weeding, health and vigor of the plants. A report on July 26, 1942 showed that 370 students were growing vegetables. Mrs. Hazel McCrampton replaced Wilcox as the Garden Supervisor and she inspected all the gardens and rated them. The gardens were very successful. Some of the more advanced gardens fed an entire family. When the Town of West Hartford takes on any project, it wants to excel. Rudolph Whaples, Hartford County agent for the 4-H Club, said that “West Hartford has a larger number of children and more successful and better organized Victory Garden program than any other city or town in the state.” Similarly, in the 1942 report on the summer playground activities, the Director of Recreation said that the town’s Victory Garden project was hailed as the most outstanding in the entire state. By July 30, 1942, the Metropolitan News, the forerunner to the West Hartford News, trumpeted that “Children’s Victory Gardens Successful; Leaders Praised.” The News reported that the average size of a garden was 8 feet by 12 feet but some were as large as 25 by 50 feet. The vegetable gardens supplied the family needs and in some cases they also had enough to can. They raised green beans, beets, cabbage, corn, cucumber, peppers, tomatoes, as well as unusual crops like tobacco, soybeans, celtuce (combination of lettuce and celery), kohlrabi, romaine, and okra. According to the News, Italian children raised “unusual greens for salads.” The children made up to three plantings on their plots of land. In mid September, the Recreation Department and the West Hartford Defense Council sponsored a Victory Garden Harvest Show at Hall High. This Harvest Fair was just one among over 20,000 held in 40 states to celebrate their harvests and raise money for the Army and Navy Emergency Relief. The government sanctioned these shows. For West Hartford, this was the first Harvest Show in years. The hope for the fair was not just to show off produce, but also to create a “better neighborhood spirit and increased interest in gardening. It is the patriotic duty of every gardener in the town to exhibit.” By show day volunteer farmers entered over 500 products in the fair. Several hundred people attended what was named “the first annual Victory Harvest Show.“ Judges awarded prizes for flowers, artistic arrangement, vegetables, fruits, houseplants, children’s flowers and vegetables, and children’s artistic arrangements. In January 1943, the town was already planning for gardens for the next growing season. Recreation Director Jacob Feldman and Superintendent of Schools Lloyd Bugbee had been working on the program for weeks and they believed that they were the first community in the state to be so far ahead. For the 1943 season, the Recreation Department agreed to hire a professional market gardener to advise and guide gardeners throughout the season. They planned to put seeds together that were varieties suitable for this area and had good productivity. They also planned to supply a bi-weekly bulletin on gardening including dates for planting, reminders on tending the crops, warnings about pests and instructions on how to deal with them. By February 1943, 800 local school children from every school in town had pledged to grow Victory Gardens. Representatives from West Hartford’s Men’s Clubs including Civitan, Hayes-Velhage Post, Exchange, Beth Israel, Kiwanis, Chamber of Commerce, Elmwood Community Church, and St. Patrick’s all agreed to promote victory gardening. The program more than doubled in participation in one year. Superintendent Bugbee again encouraged local farmers saying “by cultivating, in typical Candide fashion, their own gardens, they will be able to realize a security, a creative satisfaction and a sense of “belonging,” so essential during this period of war created insecurity.” The 2010s sustainability and locally grown movements include those same sentiments. Not only do they suggest that we gain more control of our food sources but we also build a sense of community that comes with a Community Supported Agriculture share or by visiting a local farmer’s market. Even better, grow your own garden and share with your neighbors. Resistance to Public Housing and Integration during World War II Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, April 2002. Much of this information comes from Katie Winterbottom’s research in Spring 1998. She won the Freeman and Mary Meyer in West Hartford History and her article was published in the Fall 1998 edition of The Spectator. On September 12, 1943, a West Hartford resident worried that their town would be “overrun by blacks much like what happened in the north end of Hartford.” What prompted this remark in the middle of World War II? Many families migrated to the Hartford area during the war to get defense jobs. Nationwide, over four million workers, plus five million family members, migrated to defense plants. Hartford was a big draw for workers. Colt’s Firearms by 1941 was the largest private munitions maker in the United States and the only one that made machine guns. Billings and Spencer, Pratt and Whitney Tool, all prompted the Army and Navy Munitions Board to place the city on a list as one of the 14 most vital strategic industrial areas in the country. In West Hartford, New Departure, Abbott Ball Bearing, and Whitlock Coil and Pipe all received war contracts. An estimated 18,000 people migrated to Hartford in 1941 alone, lured by jobs whose incomes rose from an average of $2,207 in 1938 to $5,208 in 1942, an increase of 136%. The housing shortage grew as the war progressed as more people moved to the area and private developers could not get the materials to build because all building materials were controlled by the government and went to the war effort. To address the housing crisis, the federal government awarded West Hartford $1,000,000 in 1943 to build housing for war workers and their families. West Hartford made plans to build 256 dormitory apartments and 72 single-family homes by June of that year. When West Hartford received the subsidies for housing, citizens and public officials expressed their concern. Frank A. Duffy, the chief of West Hartford’s Housing Authority (and mother-in-law of Louise Duffy) said he wanted “no slums in West Hartford.” He agreed to the project only after he was assured that the structures would be torn down at war’s end. Residents expressed concerns that this housing would bring people from the city and West Hartford seemed concerned about its reputation as a homogeneous, upper class suburb. The West Hartford Housing Authority imposed eligibility restrictions on housing residency: residents had to be from more than 50 miles away to qualify. West Hartford residents believed that this would insure that they would move back to their hometowns when the war was over. When the two apartment complexes were finished, by September of 1943, only about 20 out of 300 apartments were rented in Oakwood Acres (on the present day site of Kennedy Park) and only 14 of 300 in Quaker Lane Acres (near where Quaker Lane and Trout Brook Drive meet). African American defense workers applied to live in the apartments but the town authorities refused to let them rent. A realtor believed that real estate values in the area would decline sharply “if Negroes in any considerable number moved into town.” The few people who had rented the government-subsidized apartments also expressed concern, arguing that they would move out if blacks moved in. Residents looked to their U.S. Senators, Francis Maloney and John Danaher to establish whether blacks had to be allowed in. The Federal Housing Authority then investigated the situation and gave West Hartford an ultimatum: it was unconstitutional to exclude black war workers from the projects, and if the town authorities would not let them in, the federal government would take over the management of the housing. Local residents continued to fight to exclude African Americans from the government housing. They evaded the federal orders by establishing that only African Americans who worked in what they called “essential industry” in West Hartford would be allowed to live in the new government housing. Only six blacks fit this criterion and none of them wanted to move into West Hartford. No African Americans lived in this housing during World War II. The housing was never fully occupied during the war. Some West Hartford residents continued to be concerned with what they deemed to be “slums” and wanted them immediately demolished at war’s end. However, millions of veterans came home at the end of the war, and high inflation, a continued housing shortage, and many veterans who got low paying jobs needed this housing as much as the war workers had. The government aided the veterans by allowing them to move into the public housing developments occupied by war workers during the war, and the federal government paid 3/7 of the rent. In the late 1940s, the waiting list for the West Hartford housing stood at 1,500. Arguments to tear down the housing were countered with cries of patriotism and support of the veterans. But, by 1951, the campaign to rid the town of the housing began. First, no new occupants could move in. Over the next five years, residents left by choice and through pressure. On April 1, 1956, the town demolished Oakwood Acres and South Quaker Terrace housing. Elmwood Acres, the single-family homes on Elmhurst Drive were sold to a private owner. Rents increased $40 to $60 per month for the same house and some families had to leave town for economic reasons. Because of the influx of people to the Hartford area caused by the dislocation of war production, the town of West Hartford had to make decisions about racial integration that it had not had to make before. When historians study war, they evaluate to what extent social dislocations resulting from wartime emergencies bring lasting change to society. They particularly look at the lives of African Americans, women, and the poor to see if they gained a bigger piece of the American pie in terms of social, economic or political status. In this particular case, those in political power and the citizenry in West Hartford resisted change by hanging on to local control. It was not until the turmoil of the civil rights movement in the 1960s that West Hartford directly addressed these issues again. "],

Now, the town has opened the course in a movement across the country to use parks in the winter as well as the summer. In the 1940s, the town encouraged skiing and skating in the parks. The town bought the 70 acre West Hartford Golf Club for $20,000 in 1943. The town used the course as both a summer and winter venue. The Recreation Department set up three ski trails at Buena Vista and provided a first aid toboggan. The West Hartford Outing Club organized activities on a “Practice” and “Advanced” slope. They also helped get the pond in shape for skating. In February 1945, the ski committee of the West Hartford Outing Club sponsored ski racing at Buena Vista. Elementary, Junior and Senior High boys and girls ran a series of races in February with the hopes of winning an emblem for their ski jackets at the end of the season. Women await their ski run down Buena Vista hill with the new housing development in the background, circa 1945. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. On the Sunday after Christmas in 1947, according to the Hartford Courant, over 600 people skied on the three slopes. By the second week in January 1948, the town provided lights for night skiing. There was also a hill for coasters and tobogganers. The Recreation Department offered free ski lessons to both children and adults. By February 12, 1948, the Rec Department counted almost 8,000 skiers and skaters. At the same time, the town set up a skating rink behind Hall High School (the present Town Hall in the town’s center). The rink was three inches of solid ice on the ground, so parents did not have to worry about their kids falling through. On January 22, 1948, the Rec Department planned to add lights. Students at Hall could skate during gym periods. Residents could also skate at Fernridge Park, Beachland Park and Buena Vista. All three places had warming huts for skaters. On January 13, 1958, the Rec Department claimed 5,000 people “flocked to West Hartford skating, skiing, and coasting in one of the biggest turnouts in town’s history.” As late as 1972, the Parks and Rec Department sponsored free downhill ski lessons at Buena Vista. In 2017, the town has once again opened a golf course to the public in the winter. What fun to go cross country skiing at Rockledge. And, what about opening up some of these ponds to skating? Or having an outdoor rink at some of the parks or schools? School Superintendent Edmund Thorne Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, May 2007 Edmund Thorne, the town’s third superintendent, headed the biggest school building program in town history. Building eleven new elementary and junior high and high school buildings stands out as the hallmark of his tenure from 1947 to 1964. But beyond the bricks and mortar, Thorne had an educational vision that put the town at the forefront of educational policy and practice. In 1963, Thorne provided an overview of the changing issues in the schools in a 32 page annual report written for the Board of Education. Thorne’s hopes and concerns about the West Hartford Public Schools reveal much about the town, the state of education, and national trends. Thorne had much to deal with coming out of World War II. A backlog of facilities problems as a result of putting off maintenance during the war led to replacing coal fired and hand stoked boilers. Town crews replaced roofs and plumbing. Physical plants needed to be repaired. The town not only built eleven new schools between 1949 and 1964 at a total cost of under $17 million, but it also modernized and made additions to nine older schools at a cost of under $5 million. Today, building just one middle school Bristow, cost about $24 million dollars. The baby boom affected West Hartford more than other towns. A huge boom in desirable residential housing and the drive to live in this inner ring suburb led to the school population growing from about 5,000 in 1947 to 12,000 in 1963. But Thorne’s interest went beyond finding spaces for the rapidly growing school population. He was also concerned with funding the schools, teacher salaries, special education, honors programs and learning that went beyond testing. During World War II, teachers’ salaries did not keep pace with industry salaries. Many teachers left for higher paying jobs in the private sector. Teachers with less expertise and experience replaced these employees. Starting pay was $2,100, about $55 per week. The maximum salary was $4,200. Thorne believed in paying for quality. From 1961 to 1963, on the recommendation of a Citizen’s Committee, he awarded merit pay. However, difficulty in its administration led to its suspension. Thorne believed the difficulty in attracting good teachers also lay in a shortage of administrative, supervisory, and clerical staff. When Lloyd Bugbee wrote his last annual report in 1947, he stated that out of 169 towns in the state, West Hartford was ranked 90th in per pupil expenditure. At the same time, the town was the 18th from the top in wealth per pupil. Thorne believed the town should provide more support for the schools. According to Thorne, “in 1948 there were no educational provisions for physical, mental or emotional handicaps.” Thorne believed that every child should be educated to the highest level of his potential. In 1952, the first classes for “physically handicapped and “mentally retarded” children were introduced” at Duffy School. Soon after, services were added for blind and emotionally disturbed students. West Hartford led the way in special education. In 1952, nationally, parents of handicapped students founded the Council on Mental Retardation to seek services for their children with mental retardation. By 1963, the West Hartford Public Schools offered speech and hearing therapists, and a special reading consultant to improve reading among “retarded readers.” Thorne introduced the first and “still the only special classes in any Connecticut public school system for children with emotional problems.” West Hartford, by 1963, was acknowledged to have “one of the best special education programs” in the eastern United States. In 1970, U.S. schools educated only one in five children with disabilities and many states had laws excluding certain students including children who were deaf, blind, emotionally disturbed, or “mentally retarded.” The federal law that required school districts to provide education for all handicapped children did not pass until 1975. Thorne, like educators around the country, was pushed by the Soviet’s launching Sputnik in 1957. Public figures criticized the public schools for their failures. In reaction, Congress passed the National Defense Education Act to strengthen the teaching of math and science. Thorne, his administration, and his teachers instituted a number of changes to address the perceived science and math gap. At the high school, new honors courses in all academic subjects and accelerated courses in math were offered for the first time. English teachers were limited to 100 students. Science teachers replaced textbook-centered general science courses with lab-based courses. The school system received grants to encourage programs for “gifted” students. The high school sponsored a lecture series each year covering topics not included in the regular course offerings. Students had the chance to be involved in the American Field Service exchange program. But Thorne was concerned that the anxiety to act quickly to improve the public school system was pushing creative approaches “based upon a democratic philosophy and long-range goals of what was best for America,” out of the picture. Thorne worried that teachers could feel as though they needed to teach facts, not concepts. He argued that teachers: Must teach ideas that provoke thought and lead to further learning and that stimulate critical outlook. Pupils should be encouraged to question facts, seek explanations, anticipate outcomes and question the authority behind a statement or assertion. Students should ask themselves, ‘Is this the truth?’… students should be expected to learn that even scientists make mistakes as well as achieve successes, and that true learning is not achieved through an authoritative body of facts to be committed to memory but through an imaginative way of systematically exploring the unknown. Thorne placed himself write in the middle of the Cold War ideology when he wrote, “If there is anything that is going to help America survive in the struggle between East and West, it is that of developing creative minds and creative individuals, rather than those who merely parrot back isolated factual information.” Thorne’s philosophy makes me think about how much the word “creative” has dropped out of the educational lexicon with the present day pressures on testing to ensure that students are learning. How much do external pressures to increase our technological, scientific and mathematical skills make students independent learners and creative thinkers for the 21st century? It seems like Superintendent Thorne would support creative work. Christmas Carol Sing Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, December 2010 In the late 1940s, the West Hartford Recreation Department and the Chamber of Commerce sponsored a Christmas Carol Sing at the First Church and Goodman Green. On the north end of the green, town workers lit up a “Christmas Tree,” and as many as 5,000 town residents gathered for the sing and an appearance by Santa Claus. The tradition began in 1930 as an interdenominational carol sing which attracted hundreds of people. In 1940, when West Hartford added a Recreation Department to town government, as Christmas became more commercialized, and West Hartford more affluent, the celebration changed. Charles L. Rutherford, President of the Chamber of Commerce, rallied many local groups to help organize the first Christmas sing which included the Department of Recreation, the West Hartford Parent-Teacher Council, the West Hartford Exchange Club, the Kiwanis, the Civitan Club, the American Legion, and the Lions Club. On December 21, 1947, organizers expected 2,000 people to come to the 7 p.m. community Christmas Party, Carol Sing and Reception for Santa. The 20-minute carol sing rang out from the portico of First Church of Christ Congregational. More than 250 trained choral singers from the First Church and St. Thomas the Apostle, and from Talcott Junior High led the carol sing from the portico steps under direction of Gordon Stearns, choir director and organist at the First Church. Two radio stations carried the sing. Over 4,000 children and adults came to celebrate; the police were temporarily unable to bring “order out of the gaiety.” When Santa Claus arrived with a sleigh that had favors donated by 40 local businessmen, to distribute to the West Hartford children, it was hard to contain the crowd. Rutherford and his committee wanted to emphasize that Christmas was about giving. His committee wanted to help war-torn France, and with the help of the American Friends Service Committee, they organized a drive for food and school supplies to send to elementary schools in northern France. The AFSC had just won a Nobel Prize for its post war relief work and aided Rutherford’s group in selecting two schools. A West Hartford school administrator sent directions for gift giving to every public and private school student in town. The 4,000 townspeople who came to the Community Sing brought along 14 boxes of food and school supplies weighing two tons. Helpers packed the goods into duffle bags, took them to the American Legion Hall where they were packed and shipped by the Legionnaires. The committee arranged for the goods to be sent to the École de Garçons in Caen and the École de Filles Valmy in LeHavre. The Germans burned the Valmy School to the ground a few hours before the liberation of LeHavre in 1944. When the goods arrived in February 1948, the schools still had not been rebuilt and classes were being held in temporary quarters. The head of the school wrote that the children were sons and daughters of laborers who did not have a lot to eat. The packages were well received and many thank you notes made it back to students in their classrooms. The Carol Sing provided such a positive outpouring of goodwill, organizers geared up for 1948. This time organizers chose to send warm clothing and foodstuffs to “undernourished and ill-clad Sioux and Chippewa Indians in North Dakota.” In 1948 the choir would have 500 voices. Frank Groff, new music director for WHPS, organized singers from the First Congregational Church, St. James Episcopal, St. John’s Evangelist, a Talcott Junior High School group, Hall High and a select group of 5th and 6th graders. In 1948, the Chamber spearheaded the community event for a second time. The Christmas Party Committee corresponded with W.M. Simmerman, the Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The BIA suggested the goods be sent to 1,500 children of the Turtle Mountain Chippewa and the Devils Lake Sioux near Belancourt, North Dakota. In 1948 there were about 33,000 Chippewa, half in Canada and half in the United States. The Sioux were descendants of Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull and lived in poverty on government allotments. Each elementary school student who brought and wrapped a gift, put a sticker on it which read “a Package for a Papoose from West Hartford Community Christmas Party, December 19, 1948.” The committee in 1948 assured carolers and gift givers that there would not be bad weather because “We live right. That just couldn’t happen to us.” However, the carol sing, which planners thought would bring 5,000, got called off as the town was pelted with 10 inches of snow. The committee collected the gifts and sent them along to the Indians in South Dakota. Meanwhile, as the snow began to fall in the late morning, the women of the Food for Israel Campaign started collecting packages to be sent to the Holy Land. They collected over 350 bundles that were sent by trailer to New York City to be shipped to Israel. In 1949 the community supported the carol sing once again. This time, Frank Groff assembled an 800-voice choir from five churches with 600 school children’s voices. The West Hartford News encouraged townspeople to bring presents of clothing, shoes, toys, infants’ wear, and woolen garments to the children at the Shaw Center in Charleston, S.C., a “welfare center for 1,200 Negro children.” Since the end of World War II, the naval building program and other war activities were hit hard. The Carol Committee worked with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to find this group. The Shaw Center was made famous as the locale for George Gershwin’s operetta, “Porgy and Bess.” The invitation in the West Hartford News read “A traditional, gay outing for the Family. Santa will bring favors for the children, and receive gifts of clothing for little Negro boys and girls in South Carolina.” Rose Wathley, the elementary school supervisor and a member of the party committee once again organized the collection of goods from elementary school children. When the party was first established in 1947, and Wathley was on the committee, she pushed that children truly get more kick out of giving than receiving and it was her suggestion that instead of having Santa arrive at the Carol Sing with sacks of gifts for West Hartford kids, he would come to receive West Hartford children’s gifts for less fortunate boys and girls. In 1949, the committee had a 30 foot trailer truck at the carol sing so that the gifts could be loaded right on the truck to take the next day to South Carolina to get there in time for Christmas. The trucking company provided the service free of charge. The 3500 attendees donated over 1500 gifts. When the gifts reached Charleston four days later, the Community Center held the biggest party of its kind ever in Charleston. There were three to four tons of gifts. The children, recruited through the Christmas Bureau of the Charleston Welfare Council, were grateful. This community celebration showcased the varied community groups willing to work together for a common cause. Based on a Christian holiday, these celebrations are certainly the sign of a different time. Though the public celebration of Christmas is as big as ever, and the town encourages Christmas sales with its decorations, its involvement in a carol sing would not be seen as appropriate today. Supreme Court cases in the 1980s discouraged government support of Christian religious displays and West Hartford’s growing Jewish population must have forced elected officials to view its sponsorship differently after 1950. Regional Plan Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, February 2011 In 1954, insurance giant Connecticut General decided to move its headquarters out of downtown Hartford to suburban Bloomfield. This move mirrored the movement of families to the suburbs. Hartford’s population peaked in 1950 at 177,000 and in the next decade lost 15,000 residents. At the same time, West Hartford’s population grew by 18,000 residents. At its peak, Hartford’s population was quadruple West Hartford’s; now it is about double the number. Amidst this change, business leaders spoke loudly and clearly about a need for regionalism. In January 1957, the Hartford Area Chamber of Commerce urged towns in the capitol region to become part of a regional planning group. The General Assembly passed a law in 1949, amended in 1955, which enabled towns to be part of such a group. In the late 1950s, both cities and suburbs were willing to talk. Local governments voted regional planning their number one priority in a questionnaire sent out by the Chamber in 1956. In January 1957, Harold Keith, mayor of West Hartford came out firmly in favor of a regional planning authority. He asserted, “Planning cannot end at the boundaries of political subdivisions.” In late January, Hartford Councilman James H. Kinsella and Hartford State Senator Harold S. Borden requested that the General Assembly’s Legislative Council study a plan to create a federated form of government in the Greater Hartford area to include the towns of Wethersfield, Newington, West Hartford, Bloomfield and Hartford. The two men recommended that this federated government elect a proportionate common council, a metropolitan board of education, a common tax base and assessment structure, consolidated system of budgeting, financing and purchasing, centralized engineering and public works department, a unified traffic authority, centralized public health and welfare department, consolidated park and recreation department, and a regional planning and zoning agency. The bill did not pass, but it did not stop the Hartford Courant from running a three-part series entitled “The Challenge: a Study of the Future of Hartford and its Surrounding Communities,” investigating the idea of regionalism. In April 1957, their article looked at the pros and cons of a federated government in Toronto. Senator Burton believed that as suburbs grew, the city could help them, particularly in the realm of schools. He did not ingratiate himself to the suburbs when he said that their fire and police departments “weren’t worth a nickel.” Personalities aside, talk of regionalism abounded. Almost 300 town officials attended a June 11, 1957 Regional Planning Conference sponsored by Governor Abraham Ribicoff and the Hartford Chamber of Commerce Regional Planning Committee and the Chamber’s organizations in surrounding towns. Participants from 18 towns listened to experts from around the country outline the advantages of regional planning groups. At the conference, Democrat Ward Duffy, editor of the Hartford Times and West Hartford resident, led a panel discussion with Richard Brown, West Hartford’s Town Planner. Brown argued that small towns would not get swallowed up by the big city in regional planning, but instead “could swing Hartford by the tail.” Ward Duffy, editor of the Hartford Times, helped to lead discussions about regionalization in the Hartford area. He and his wife Louise Duffy lived in the Whitman House on 208 North Main Street, in the home where he grew up. His father, Frederick Duffy, was a school teacher, and the head of housing in West Hartford during World War II. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. By November 1957, West Hartford’s Mayor Keith seemed fed up with the state dragging its feet in establishing a Regional Planning Commission, dictated by state statute. The Democratic-led Town Council, the first ever, with the first ever Democratic Mayor from 1955 to 1959, pushed for regional planning for the town. Keith criticized the State Development Commission for not setting up the region for the Hartford area. Keith was particularly concerned about the planning of the East-West highway, Interstate 84 whose route through West Hartford had gone through numerous iterations at this point. On September 10, 1958, the West Hartford Town Council voted unanimously to be part of the Capital Planning Region. At the same time, the Chambers of Commerce continued their trumpet call for regionalism. In February 1958, James E. Kelley, president of the West Hartford Chamber established a committee representing 11 Chambers in the region. However, he noted, West Hartford was the only town that had endorsed participation in the Regional Planning Commission by that point. By July 1958, the 22 towns went into the process of voting to be part of the Capital Area Regional Planning Authority. Sixty percent of the towns had to approve the Authority before it started operating. All towns had two votes except those over 50,000. This give Hartford six votes, and three votes each for West Hartford, East Hartford, and Manchester. The purpose of the authority was to “further the orderly zoning of towns.” It would have a hand in industrial expansion, highway relocation, main park and recreational areas, water supplies, flood control and stream pollution. The planning group was established as an advisory group. The towns in the Capitol region included Hartford, East Hartford, West Hartford, Windsor, East Windsor, South Windsor, Windsor Locks, Manchester, Glastonbury, Wethersfield, Rocky Hill, Newington, Bloomfield, Farmington, Avon, Simsbury, East Granby, Ellington, Vernon, Tolland and Bolton. By July 1958, Granby voted not to become part of the group. The decision to participate had to be made at Town Meeting. In November, the West Hartford League of Women Voters took on the issue of regional planning and held three discussion groups at member’s homes throughout town. Two meetings were held during the day and one at night. One of the discussion leaders was Mrs. Richard Brown, the wife of West Hartford’s Town Planner. Another was Joan Kemler who went on to represent West Hartford in the General Assembly. The League wanted dialogue about regionalism and the talk only served to increase support among progressives in town. Mayor Harold Keith also worked to sell the idea and held meetings during the year with community organizations like the Rotary and Civitans to get them to support the Authority. When Keith chose not to run for re-election in 1959, he became chair of the CRPA. The Authority received $25,000 in federal funds and so built a two year plan to prepare base maps for the area concerning topography, soil, zoning, development, traffic, transit, public utilities and recreation. This topic or regionalism came to my attention as I framed a 1959 West Hartford map drawn by the Capitol Region Planning Council. This map included the proposed east-west highway, with an off-ramp at Park Road that went north to empty out at Farmington Avenue. It included the proposed Route 291, which went north from the east west highway right through the MDC Reservoir. This part of the “regional plan” led to protest and its demise in the mid-1970s. While the push for regionalism in the 1950s came in a time of prosperity when there was a large migration from city to suburb. Today talk of regionalism is a cry from those trying to trim municipal budgets in times of recession. Out of prosperity or recession, the idea of regionalism continues to have its followers. The Advent of the East-West Highway Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, August 2000 Camp Courant at Park Road and Trout Brook? The Oakwood Gardens Housing Project? Kane’s Woods? The South Quaker Lane Housing Project? These were all sites in West Hartford on one of the proposed routes for the new East-West Highway in the 1940s and 1950s. The housing projects have been torn down, Camp Courant moved, and Kane’s Woods developed into a shopping center and apartments. The East-West Highway, now Interstate I-84, takes a more southerly route through town. How did the federal and state government convince the town to engage in this $25 million (in the early 1960s) infrastructure project? Moves to the suburbs in the post-World War II period, according to most historians, were escapes into conformity and consumerism away from the complexity, activism, and excitement of the city. Americans were happy to retreat to their suburbs with the help of federal housing subsidies for GIs. But a look at the state and federal governments’ attempt to put an east-west highway through West Hartford reveals a population ready and able to challenge authority. This fight, along with conflicts over building schools in the 1950s, made West Hartford a place shaped by conflict and community activism. Citizens of West Hartford fended off building the highway for more than 15 years. By 1949, 60% of the traffic that entered Hartford came from West Hartford. The local east-west roads, New Britain Avenue, Park Road, and Farmington Avenue were clogged with traffic and the state felt an east-west highway would help solve the traffic problem. West Hartford’s population in 1950 stood at about 62,000, a leap of over 25% since 1940. The population grew as the insurance industry in Hartford prospered. West Hartfordites, who fashioned themselves as the residents of an upscale residential community, did not believe the highway was necessary and thought it would split the town in half, and ruin its residential character. The first plans for the highway were floated in 1945. In this plan, the highway would have gone through the center of town. At the first public in 1948, 500 protesting residents showed up, forcing officials to move the meeting from the Town Hall to the Hall High Auditorium right next door. Townspeople expressed strong opposition to a proposed plan that would have sent the highway from Prospect Street at Warrenton directly west running between Boulevard and Farmington Avenue. Just west of the Kingswood School, it would turn south to follow Trout Brook to Taylor Road to meet the highway section from Corbins Corner. In 1950, West Hartford’s Town Council approved a more southerly route that would have gone from Prospect at Park, through the World War II housing project, Oakwood Gardens (now Kennedy Park), up Oakwood Avenue and through the South Quaker Lane World War II housing. But, the state did not follow through at that time. Planners had as many as eight possible routes for the highway by 1956. In January 1956, 350 residents met at the Smith School to protest the highway and formed the East-West Residents Association, elected permanent officers and voted to oppose “Plan C” as proposed by the state highway department. Residents believed that widening the main east-west arteries, staggering work hours in Hartford, installing one-way streets at rush hour working in cooperation with the Hartford City Council, they could solve the traffic problem. At a public hearing held at Smith School in September 1956, 300 residents as well as the clergy of the newly built St. Mark’s Parish (1947) protested the highway. The Town Council unanimously voted down the newest proposed route. The East-West Residents Association pushed the Town Council to commission still another study of the proposed routes. Part of the 1956 plan was to build a connector from the highway at Park Road and Trout Brook north along Trout Brook to Farmington Avenue to improve the movement of north-south traffic. This would have eliminated Norfeldt baseball field, a town garage, two gas stations on the corner of Farmington Avenue and Trout Brook, Bess Eaton Doughnut, a new building containing the Nichols Cordial Shoppe, and Chicken Delight, among other buildings. Trout Brook Drive was still not completed between Boulevard and Farmington. Though residents worried that the opening of Connecticut Life Insurance Company in Bloomfield on January 1, 1957 would exacerbate traffic problems, they fought at more public hearings to stop the connector. The Town Council appeal both to the Federal Bureau of Roads and the State Highway Department was denied in early 1960. Some local politicians believed they still might stop the road but most realized they could only revamp the plan by that point, particularly what they called then the “butterfly approaches” to the highway which residents saw taking up too much land. The Federal Bureau of Roads finally approved the east-west highway project in January 1960, 15 years after the first plan was floated. Still, some Town Councilors wanted to appeal the decision because the federal government had not done enough to consider the economic consequences to the town. But the majority of the town was resigned to the highway. The state had already spent about $5 million buying properties along the route. By 1961, the plan that would have taken 18 homes ten years earlier, took 144. This led to a loss of $5 million on the town’s grand list. By this time, resigned to the highway, some Town Councilors argued, that commercial property along the route, especially at Corbin’s Corner and Prospect would increase in value. Plans moved forward to start construction in October 1962. But there was one more surprise in store for the residents just west of South Main Street and north of New Britain Avenue. Engineers decided that it was too difficult to run the highway over South Main Street. This meant that eight houses on Brightwood Lane would have to be torn down because of the grade of the hill needed when they dug under South Main Street. One of the houses belonged to former Mayor Harold Keith, a vehement opponent of the highway for at least ten years. Negotiations with the state highway department led to building the retaining wall south of the entrance to I-84 on South Main Street. All eight houses were saved. The highway opened in the fall of 1964. The section from Corbins Corner to Trout Brook was attached to the new section, now known as the “West Hartford Curves” and went as far east as Prospect. The highway was not completed through Hartford until 1969. West Hartford residents and their elected representatives were not complacent when the state and federal government tried to impose a plan that was perceived as being for the larger good. Residents organized and pushed their elected representatives to use every appeal to, as they saw it, save the character of their town. The calm veneer of the suburb hid a contentious residential population, concerned about the nature of their town. Simultaneously, battles concerning the fate of the World War II housing and building new schools came up yearly as residents fought to define the type of town in which they lived. A Special Bond between West Hartford’s Jews and Israel Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, July 2008 The Greater Hartford Jewish Federation marked Israel’s 60th anniversary on June 1 with a celebration at West Hartford’s Mandell Jewish Community Center. This celebration marks more than 100 years of support for Israel in the Hartford region. Ronnie Siegel of West Hartford, the event coordinator, was born in Israel the year it became an independent country. The JCC was a natural place for this event, as it has been a hub for the Jewish community in the Hartford region since 1962. In Making a Life, Building a Community: A History of the Jews of Hartford (1997), David Dalin argues that the Hartford area was an early and important center of American Zionism. Zionists support the establishment and continuation of an independent state of Israel. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Jews in Hartford were united about the need for the establishment of a Jewish state. The size and strength of this consensus was unmatched in other metropolitan areas. Dalin argues that: all members of the Hartford rabbinate, whatever their differences on other religious and ideological issues, shared a passionate and unequivocal commitment to the Zionist cause… Indeed, during the 1940s, Hartford was one of the few American cities with a large and historically venerable German Jewish Reform component in which the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism did not establish a strong organizational foothold. Perhaps it was the size of the region and its large proportion of Jewish residents that helped to unite the Jews. Dalin suggests it was leaders like Rabbi Abraham Feldman who helped unite all Hartford area Jews to the Zionist cause. Rabbi Abraham Feldman served Beth Israel from 1935 to 1968. The synagogue was the first to move to West Hartford in 1936. Feldman organized a local rabbinic organization that drew active participation of Orthodox, Conservative and Reform congregations. Source: Jewish Historical Society of Greater Hartford. The idea of a “land of Israel” goes back to Biblical times as told in Psalms and is found in the daily liturgy of the Jewish service. The theological ideas of Zion first found a political voice in the late 19th century as nationalism and socialism took hold in Europe. In 1882, a group of Russian Jewish students went to Palestine, then a part of the Ottoman Empire, to begin an agricultural community. In 1885, the Jewish Reform Movement in the United States adopted the “Pittsburgh Platform” that denounced building a political nation. The American Reform movement stated that it did not want to be a nation, but instead saw themselves as a “religious community” and did not expect to return to Palestine or establish a Jewish state. Historically, this position made sense in the context of the late 19th century United States. Jews, and particularly German Jews, had reached a certain point of acceptance in the U.S. They believed that the freedom they experienced in the United States made a separate “Zion” unnecessary. Isidore Wise is a good example of a man who “made it” in America. He and Gershon Fox, also Jewish, both owned department stores downtown. Wise was the president of Congregation Beth Israel (1907-1942) and owned Wise, Smith &amp; Company, a department store on the west side of Main Street right across from G. Fox &amp; Co. He was president of Beth Israel when the congregation was on Charter Oak Avenue in Hartford. However, with increased Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe caused in part by continued pogroms in Russia, and more tension even within the Jewish community in the U.S., the ideas of the American Reform Movement began to shift in favor of a Zionist state. Rabbi Abraham J. Feldman, who served Beth Israel from 1925-1968, was a leader in West Hartford, Connecticut and nationally, and an ardent Zionist as well as part of the American Reform Movement, beginning in his student days. At the University of Cincinnati, Feldman invited lawyer Louis D. Brandeis, a passionate Zionist, to come speak to the Jewish Honor Society called the Menorah Society in 1914. Brandeis was a leader of the American Zionist movement. In 1916, Woodrow Wilson appointed him to the U.S. Supreme Court where he served until his death in 1939. Even while Brandeis served on the Supreme Court, he worked actively for the Zionist cause. In 1918, at Hebrew Union College, Feldman challenged the president of the college to debate him on Zionism. Feldman was one of the key local and national players who took on the challenge of uniting Reform Judaism with Zionism. He brought those strong beliefs to town and continued to organize and support Zionism throughout his tenure at Beth Israel. In 1921, the Hartford Jewish community held one of its first public events in support of Zionism when Chaim Weizmann, head of the World Zionist Organization, who went to become the first president of Israel, came to Hartford with internationally renowned scientist Albert Einstein. They arrived in a motorcade of 500 cars and 15,000 spectators lined the streets. Unlike most other cities, Hartford’s rabbis were united behind the Zionist idea. Einstein and Weizmann had lunch at the Hotel Garde and then both men addressed the packed house at the Capitol Theater, which at that time had the largest seating capacity of any theater in New England. The two men raised $100,000 for the World Zionist Organization. By the time Israel proclaimed its independence in 1948, middle- and upper-class Jews had moved from the Front Street area of Hartford to its West and North Ends and into West Hartford. Both Congregation Beth Israel (1936) and Beth David Synagogue (1943) had opened in town and Rabbi Feldman established a local rabbinic organization that drew the active participation of Orthodox, Conservative and Reform rabbis, ones with whom he vocally disagreed, but whose unity made the Jewish community stronger. Unlike other metropolitan areas, the Hartford region’s Orthodox, Conservative and Reform congregations all supported Zionism early on. This support has not always been easy as unrest continues in the Middle East. West Hartford’s united celebration of Israel’s independence in 2008 shows, in part, a long history of Jewish cooperation in the Hartford region. Schools for Democracy Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, March 2001. Sources include “Histories of West Hartford Schools,” West Hartford Public Schools, 1964, found in the Conard High School Library; David Halberstam, The Fifties (1993); and James Patterson, Grand Expectations (1996). School buildings and elementary school districts often have been the way people identify their neighborhoods in West Hartford. Families in the 1920s and 1950s supported their children being redistricted in town as the population surged in each of these decades and new schools were built. The growth in West Hartford’s Public Schools mirrors the growth of West Hartford as a suburb. Until the turn of the century, most West Hartford students went to one of the eight one- and two- room district school houses throughout the town. Charter Oak School, built in 1884, housed grades K through 8. The first Center School, just south of the Old Burial Ground, was built in the 1860s and housed the first high school students on its second floor. A new Center School (1896) was built as an elementary school and was later renamed Whitman School and then became the police station. The Seymour School (later Smith School) opened in 1915. By 1920, West Hartford had a population of about 8,000 people, mostly living along the major east west thoroughfares of Farmington Avenue, Boulevard, Park Road, and New Britain Avenue. With the growth in automobile ownership in the 1920s, West Hartford’s population tripled to about 24,000 by 1930. During this decade, eight schools were built in town. Three elementary schools, Beach Park (1926), Morley (1927) and Elmwood (1928) opened in a two-year span. Three junior highs (grades 7 to 9) opened between 1922 and 1931: Plant (1922), Talcott (1922) and Sedgwick (1931) that originally opened as a K to 9 school. High school students moved from the second floor of the Center School to William Hall High School (now the Town Hall) when it opened its doors in 1924. Both the Great Depression and World War II led to a decline in home building in most of the country, but in West Hartford, the population actually grew by 76 percent between 1930 and 1940. West Hartford land developers built and sold many new homes. Nationwide, housing starts fell from just over one million per year to about 100,000 between 1930 and 1945. During the war, it was difficult for builders to siphon supplies from the war industries to build new homes. When the war ended, the building began. Pent up savings, the baby boom, and highways all led to tremendous growth in West Hartford. West Hartford’s population grew from about 42,000 in 1950 to over 60,000 in 1960. Between 1949 and 1959, the town built nine elementary schools including: Webster Hill (1949) Bugbee (1950) Duffy (1952) Whiting Lane (1954, replacing the old East School) King Philip (1955, also a junior high) Braeburn (1956) Wolcott (1957) Norfeldt (1957) Bridlepath (1959) The town built the elementary schools where the developers built the houses. After World War II, developers began mass-producing houses. Before World War II, most builders built about five houses per year. After the war, because of the influence of men like William Levitt whose teams of men could build 36 houses in one day, 180 per week and 8,000 per year, the pace of building increased. When Bugbee was built in 1950, it was the only elementary school north of Fern Street and west of Trout Brook. Its district included one-third of the geographical area of the town and was served by six busses. Before 1950, “north end” kids attended Sedgwick or the small Beach Park School. The north end experienced rapid development. Look at the growth in Bugbee’s population over its first 3 years: September 1950 - June 1951 from 365 to 418 students September 1951 - June 1952 from 529 to 584 students Summer 1952 150 students moved to Duffy September 1952 - June 1953 from 460 to 546 students By 1957, the student population settled in around 500 with the opening of Duffy, King Philip, Braeburn, and Norfeldt. In the early 1960s, school officials were nervous about the potential development of the Hunter farm on Flagg Road. They saw this property as having “potential development of embarrassing proportions” if a developer purchased that land. Instead, the town acquired the property which became Westmoor Park. When Conard High School opened in 1957, the high school population was divided for the first time. Hall High, in the center of town became a “walking school.” All those within a two-mile radius of the school attended. Those who lived in the north and south ends of town went to Conard. These districts did not change until the new Hall opened on North Main Street in 1970. John Davison, a student at Sedgwick in the 1950s, and a former chair of the Board of Education, remembered his friends being redistricted yearly as Sedgwick became overcrowded and new elementary schools opened. Families moved to West Hartford for a school system that developed a national reputation for excellence. People came from around the nation and the world to view West Hartford’s new schools for both their architecture and their curricula. In the early 1970s, West Hartford’s population peaked at 70,000 and in the next decade, the town lost 10,000 residents. In the 1970s and 1980s, the town closed several schools. Beach Park School was closed in 1972 (and now is St. Joseph School for Young Children), the Elmwood School was closed in 1975 (and now is the community center), Bridlepath (now Solomon Schecter), and Whitman (now the police station) all closed because of declining enrollment. Smith School closed and then reopened in 1995. Both Talcott and Plant Junior Highs (7th to 9th grade schools) closed in 1979. The two high schools took on the 9th graders and Sedgwick and King Philip became 6th through 8th grade middle schools. The closing of these schools was very controversial. Parents, concerned about which parts of town took the biggest hits, questioned whether schools were closed in the geographical areas with fewest students. Redistricting in the 1920s and the 1950s did not carry the same political volatility as that of closing schools in the 1970s and 1980s nor of the redistricting in the mid-1990s. Growth in the 1920s and 1950s came with a robust economy and grand expectations. People wanted the best schools for their children, and during these times, the best schools were new ones. Growth fueled the idea that life continued to get better in the suburbs in the 1950s. Today, parents and politicians look on redistricting with fear and trepidation. They worry that their children will be shuffled from one school to another, a move forced by a redistribution of the population, not necessarily growth. With the state law that mandates that a school’s population cannot exceed 25% above or below the average racial percentage for the town, some parents argue their children are being redistricted for political reasons. But the state and many parents agree that guaranteeing equal educational opportunity for all can only be had if the schools are not racially isolated. This, the state argues, is part of the foundation of democracy. The Korean War Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, June 2005 The Korean War armistice was signed on July 27, 1953 and when the news made it to Hugh Campbell, the manager of the Central Theater in West Hartford Center, he interrupted the film that was playing and joyfully announced the truce. The next day he and his wife got a telegram from the Defense Department. Their son Raymond B. Campbell, aged 23, was killed in action on July 24, 1953, just three days before the armistice. Campbell was a heavy machine gunner in the Marine Corps and enlisted in March 1951, nine months after the war began. He worked at Pratt and Whitney Aircraft after attending Hall High School. Campbell left his mother and father, and seven siblings. His brother, John was in the Army in Korea. Like other wars, West Hartford felt the effects of the Korean War through the eleven men who died over a span of five years. The average age of those who died in the war was 24, with the youngest 20 and the oldest 30. Four of the eleven men were married and three had children. Seven of the eleven men died in hostile action. The U.S. suffered about 33,000 combat deaths and 20,000 from other causes. West Hartford men died in about this same ratio. During the Korean War, 1.5 million men, 18 to 25, were drafted; another 1.3 million volunteered, primarily for the Navy and Air Force. The Korean War grew directly out of the division of Korea in August of 1945 into Soviet Union and the United States occupation zones. Both the Soviets and the Americans believed that Korea should be independent at war’s end, but needed to be occupied because it was not yet ready for self-government. When the Soviets entered the war against Japan on August 8, 1945, two days after the U.S. dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, some Soviet troops entered Korea and a week later, Truman and Stalin agreed that the Soviets would occupy the area north of the 38th parallel and the U.S. would occupy the area south of that line. In 1947, a United Nations resolution called for elections in Korea to create an independent government. The Soviets would not allow for an election to take place in the north and they installed communist Premier Kim Il Sung as leader, while Syngman Rhee was elected President of the south. On June 25, 1950, North Korean troops, many fresh from the communist victory in China, attacked South Korea. United Nations forces, of which the United States made the majority, fought back. By the end of September, UN forces approached the 38th parallel. In October, UN forces crossed into North Korea. The Chinese said they would enter the war if the UN forces moved into North Korea. China entered the war in late October 1950. When MacArthur ordered an “end-the-war offensive” in November, it was met by a Chinese offensive which renewed the war. These offensives forced the UN ground forces south for two months. It was this battle that led to the first three West Hartford casualties. Kenneth Tackus, 111 Ridgewood Road, was killed in action at age 23 when he was fighting near the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea, December 1, 1950. He was in one of the infantry divisions which reached the Manchurian border in the northeastern part of Korea just before the Chinese attacked. Tackus went to Hall High and Fishburne Military Academy where he was valedictorian of his class. He graduated from West Point in June 1950 and was married the following day. He left behind his wife and his parents in West Hartford. Bernard Kelly, of 75 South Street, was reported missing in action on December 2, 1950 in fighting around the Chosin Reservoir in Korea and the retreat to the Hungnam beachhead. He was in a heavy mortar battalion. His parents last heard from him on November 17, 1950, but were not told he was missing in action until February 1, 1951, two and a half months later. Kelly enlisted in the Army when he turned 18. He went to West Hartford Schools and was employed at the Royal Typewriter when he enlisted. Three of his brothers served in World War II. Gordon “Pete” Kuehner, Jr. of Farmington Avenue was the pilot of a B-26C based at Kunsan Air Force Base (K-8) en route to a target on a night intruder mission when his aircraft was lost on December 28, 1950. He was 28 when he died. This was the third time his mother received such a telegram. During World War II, her first telegram informed her that her youngest son Dick was killed in a fighter plane over France. A second telegram told that Pete was missing in the Aleutian Islands. This telegram was nullified when he was picked up by the Russians. His mother had hope, in February 1951 that her new telegram would be nullified as well. Kuehner was married and had a three year old son who was named after his brother Dick, killed in WWII. His son Dick wouldn’t learn for sure that his father was dead for another three years. His wife and son were with him when he was stationed in the Philippines before the war in Korea broke out and Kuehner volunteered to go fight. Kuehner’s last letter, delivered with the telegram, said “How long can a guy’s luck hold out? Well, I’m sure I want to fight this war here, not in the United States, not where those I love might be hurt.” Kuehner’s letter outlined the beliefs of the time of those fighting the Cold War. In early 1951, MacArthur pushed to attack China. In April, Truman fired him. Washington’s objective was to restore the status quo. Donald Sirman, aged 29 of Van Buren Avenue, died on June 14, 1951. He was the pilot of an F-80C Shooting Star fighter interceptor while on a combat mission and was shot down by North Korean anti-aircraft fire on July 7, 1950. He survived the crash and was taken a Prisoner of War. His parents knew he was alive because his name and picture were used in North Korean propaganda broadcasts. He died while a prisoner less than a year later. Truce talks began in July 1951. Diplomats decided to split the country at the battle line, but could not resolve the issues over prisoners of war like Donald Sirman. In 1952, the war continued mostly as air strikes on North Korea. At least 2 million Korean civilians and one million soldiers were killed. As many as one million Chinese may have been killed. Frank E. Woodcock, aged 24 of 1199 New Britain Avenue was killed in action on August 17, 1952. He was a veteran of World War II and a member of the active reserve. He held a degree from the University of Vermont. He was employed by Niles Bement Pond before being recalled to the service. He left his wife and a 9 month old son in Elmwood, and his parents and four siblings in Vermont. Robert Wegner of 127 South Quaker Lane, aged 22 died two weeks after he was wounded from a mine explosion on October 29, 1952. After the injury, he had his left leg amputated and was in danger of losing his right leg. He died about a week after the amputation. He was a football star at Hall High and attended the University of Connecticut for two years. He enlisted on his birthday in 1951 when he turned 21. Like the other wars, West Hartford’s war dead mirror the action in the war. By knowing the men from the town who died, it makes us remember the cruel and ugly realities of war. Knowing the houses that men lived in, where their children grew up without them, and the fiancés who lost their lovers makes us think of this ultimate sacrifice. Some argue that brutal wars like in Korea keep there from being war again. Larry Phillipon’s ultimate sacrifice in Iraq at the beginning of May 2006 reminds us that the young, brave and strong continue to die for their country and that the effect of the pain at home seems never to diminish. West Hartford’s U.S. Senator William Purtell Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, January 2007 On July 29, 1959, Republican Senatorial candidate William Purtell addressed 150 women who belonged to the Hartford County Women’s Republican Association in Avon. He said women have the major influence in controlling the nation’s economy due to their role purchasing consumer goods for their homes. He then urged them to get involved and exert influence in political activities on the same level. William Purtell’s awareness of women’s role in government surely came from his sister, Edna, who was the youngest suffragist at age 19 to go on a hunger strike with the National Woman’s Party in Washington. The suffragists were arrested in front of the White House in 1918 chanting, “Mr. President, how long must women wait for liberty?” Over 30 years later, Edna, who never married, still lived in West Hartford as did her brother William. Born in 1897, William Purtell grew up in a poor family in Hartford and left high school after only two years. His first job was in a rail yard. This led him to his second job which was scheduling wartime rail shipments to Colt’s Firearms. Purtell enlisted in World War I in 1917. Upon his return to West Hartford, in 1919, he spent ten years as a salesman. In September 1929, at age 32, he founded the Holo-Krome Screw Corporation. On the day the stock market crashed in 1929, Purtell and his two co-owners turned out their first innovative socket screw. No longer was a screw machine needed to produce these parts which made their production much less expensive. Purtell soon secured a patent for his cold-forged socket screw which allowed for the mass production of high tensile alloy steel socket screws. Founding the company at the beginning of the Depression was not so easy, but early on Purtell realized that his company’s fortune was tied to his workers. He held his employees in high regard and they willingly took short paychecks at times when the company was in financial trouble. Purtell’s company introduced one of the first profit sharing programs for workers in the country. A breakthrough came for Holo-Krome when they sold the socket screw to Detroit’s auto manufacturers, putting the company on firm footing. In 1936, Holo-Krome, with 40 workers, moved to Newington Road. By 1938, the company was doing so well that Purtell bought Billings and Spencer, a tool and forge firm. The company became a supplier of military parts during the Second World War. By 1946, Holo-Krome became a subsidiary of Veeder Root, a larger company that Purtell later headed. He also served as president of the Connecticut Manufacturers’ Association and as a director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Purtell was known for his speaking ability. He helped organized the American Legion in Connecticut and spoke on their behalf. He used his speaking engagements to talk about how solutions to social problems should be solved by private initiative. Only after the private sector tried to solve the problems, should the government step in. According to Jack Zaiman, the Hartford Courant political writer, Purtell was a great campaigner because he “was an industrialist, with a vibrant, peppery, glad-handing approach.” In 1950, the Republican Party came to Purtell asking him to run for Governor. He said he did not want to run, but when they chose John Lodge, he changed his mind and went into the convention looking for the nomination despite the leadership backing Lodge. His skills as a speaker endeared him to many voters as he traveled around the state to garner delegates. But he lost the Republican nomination to John Lodge who ended up winning the election. Purtell continued to run his business, but kept his interest in politics Connecticut’s Republican Governor John Lodge made amends with his adversary when he appointed West Hartford’s Purtell to the U.S. Senate seat after Brien McMahon of Norwalk died in office in the summer of 1952. Purtell was already running for the open Senate seat –- he had won the nomination against Prescott Bush who was supported by the organization. Prescott Bush (R) defeated Abe Ribicoff (D) in the November election for this seat and Purtell defeated incumbent Senator William Benton for the other Senate seat. In the course of six months, he held both of Connecticut’s Senatorial seats. Purtell was an independent Republican who kept the party at arm’s length. During the campaign, Wisconsin’s Senator Joseph McCarthy came to the state and spoke in Waterbury. Purtell did not appear with McCarthy, spurning his help. To voters, Purtell represented “clean independence, unmarred by political clichés.” Purtell was most proud of his aid to deaf children and help to low income groups. Even though he saw his political career as “less than successful,” he had numerous accomplishments. He served as member of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee and the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. He served on subcommittees which dealt with juvenile delinquency, welfare and pension plan legislation and health. One of his most important assignments came when he was appointed by then Vice President Richard Nixon to the select committee to investigate lobbying. He was also an official observer at the United Nations Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva in 1955. As a businessman, Purtell believed in “competitive capitalism” to solve the social problems of the day. In a speech before Jewish war veterans in 1956, he urged the private sector rather than the federal government to take care of social problems. In this way, Purtell argued, capitalism would always win out in the Cold War over communism. In 1956, Purtell traveled to Russia to try to open up investment opportunities for American businesses. Purtell also voted for price supports for tobacco farmers. Purtell was viewed as a liberal Republican who supported increases in foreign aid, particularly to fight communism. He also supported a reduction in the age for women to collect Social Security to age 62. He protected the rights of children in urban areas in relationship to their rights to Social Security. In 1956, at the Republican Convention, there were rumors that Purtell would run for Governor in 1958 against Abe Ribicoff, but he did not choose to do so. In an interesting turn of events, Purtell’s sister Edna was hired by Democratic Representative Tom Dodd to head his office of women’s concerns. When Purtell ran for reelection in 1958, Democrat Thomas J. Dodd who lived on Concord Street in West Hartford defeated him. The circumstances for a Democrat were ripe in 1958 as it was the midterm election during a Republican presidency. Dodd was a real politician who worked the Democrats in the state. Purtell tried to attack Dodd on his record, without doing much to stand on his own record. Back as a private citizen, Purtell ran a small machine tool shop in East Haddam. Bill Purtell died at his home on 6 Arlington Road at age 81 in 1978. Purtell’s background as a business owner and his great speaking ability led him to success in politics. Though he never finished high school, he never felt that citizens should see that as something to emulate. Purtell never wanted to downplay the importance of an education and wrote a letter to the editor claiming that times had changed so much in the economy that he should not have been looked at a role model for that reason. He continually stressed the importance of a good education for all citizens. Public Art in West Hartford Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, August 2008 The West Hartford Art League is sponsoring Art Walk in September 2008, and as part of their celebration will include a self-guided public art walk. Though the concept of public art is not new, the local government’s sponsorship of the recent Busby sculpture “Bear,” denotes a change in public support for public art. The addition of a Charles Perry sculpture on the corner of South Main and Memorial Drive and the installation of a kinetic sculpture by Tim Prentice by the West Hartford Art League’s pond this fall will continue the partnership between the West Hartford Art League and the Town of West Hartford. What is the history of the town and its public art? A good first stop on a public art tour through the center is the Old Burial Ground. West Hartford’s first manifestation of public art can be seen in the two cemeteries on North Main Street. The Old Burial Ground, less than an acre in area, set up in 1719, has stones dating between 1725 and 1869. About 200 people are buried there. Look at the art on the pre 19th century gravestones. The Stancliff Shop in Middletown probably made James Watson’s stone. The floating punctuation, the uppercase lettering and the rosettes on the shoulders of the stone are all signatures of this shop. Stancliff popularized the rosettes’ use on stones. The stones of Benjamin Colton (1713-59) and Stephen Keyes may have self-portraits on them. Lt. Joseph Gillitt’s gravestone has a skull, which reminded those who looked of death and resurrection. Gillit was one of the first 29 people to establish the church in the West Division in 1713. Find Rachel Marshfield’s stone in the southeast corner of the burial ground. Her stone has an hourglass showing that time had run out. It has two flowers, one alive, and one dead and severed by a scythe, showing the frailty of life. In the 18th century, the church and the government were one and the same. Town meetings were held in the meeting house/church; landowners paid property taxes, which supported the church. Though individuals paid for their own headstones, the church/local government took care of the burial ground. The Old North Cemetery, just north of the Old Burial Ground, next to the Baptist Church, is almost seven acres. Established in 1790 when the Old Burial Ground was filled, the cemetery still allows some descendants of those buried in this cemetery to be interred there. The monuments in this cemetery show the development of gravestone art. Gone are the death’s heads and poems to be replaced by standards like the urn and the willow tree. In this cemetery you’ll find a large monument to those who fought and died in the Civil War. As the town turned from a farm village into a suburb, the number of public buildings increased. When Hall High was built in 1924 and the Town Hall and Library in 1936, there was also talk of public art. In December 1935, Walter O. Korder (1891-1962) was commissioned to paint his Connecticut History mural at Hall High School. He was one of 76 artists in Connecticut employed by the federal government’s Works Progress Administration (WPA). Two artists, Philip Smith and Francis C. Thwing were hired to assist. It was not until 1947, however, that Korder completed his Connecticut murals. Korder began painting, but stopped when wartime conditions made it impossible to get the necessary paints and supplies to complete his work. He had to suspend the work for six years. The murals show Connecticut history from the Vikings to the hanging of John Brown in 1859. Some scenes include the landing of Thomas Hooker and his party in Hartford, the signing of the Connecticut Charter, and the founding of Yale. Korder was a legendary art teacher in West Hartford and by 1947, past president of the West Hartford Art League. Korder’s paintings hang in two other public buildings in West Hartford. He has two paintings at Charter Oak Academy, one of Hansel and Gretel at the witch’s house and the other Winkin’, Blinkin’ and Nod, both painted in 1931. At Conard, Korder’s portrait of Frederick U. Conard hangs in the library. While Korder was painting his mural, the public private collaboration on the Noah Webster statue was fraught with difficulty. Korczak Ziolkowski’s (1908-1982) Noah Webster statue was just recently refurbished and moved several hundred yards north on South Main Street to act as a beacon to Blue Back Square. As part of the agreement between the town and the Blue Back Square, the developers paid for refurbishing this statue of West Hartford’s favorite son. Korczak Ziolkowski and his wife sculpt the Noah Webster Statue in 1941. Here Ziolkowski is carving his message to the townspeople, setting in stone his feeling that those in town did not understand what brotherhood meant. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. West Hartford’s Town Council officially supported Ziolkowski’s carving of Webster. In an October 1940 news article in the Hartford Courant, the reported said “Town officials may acquire the marble portrait as a memorial.” Town leaders including Superintendent of Schools Lloyd Bugbee, Rev. Elden Mills of the First Church of Christ and the pastor of St. James Episcopal Church George Guiness all inspected a model of the statue at Ziolkowski’s house. By February 1941, Mrs. Russell Z. Johnston, chairman of the Noah Webster Sculpture Commission reported that she had received 700 contributions to pay for materials and labor of about $17,000. Those who canvassed the townspeople “reported that residents were very enthusiastic toward the project.” Governor and Mrs. Robert Hurley who lived at 99 Outlook Avenue at the time, headed the list of sponsors. By May, the committee had raised $4,000 and Ziolkowski agreed to go ahead with the statue. Though the Town Council approved the plan and the placement of the statue on the new Town Hall’s lawn, they did not help monetarily. Ziolkowski donated his services and used the money to buy the stone and pay his assistants. Ziolkowski carved this classical sculpture from a single 32 ton block of southern marble. Ziolkowski never formally turned over the title for the piece to the town. For those with good eyes, check the base of Ziolkowski’s statue where he decries the lack of support of the town. On one of the sculpted books at the base, Ziolkowski wrote: “For you I labored not for my own day, that by the word, men should know brotherhood. My Fellow Men! You have not understood, since each of you would go his separate way.” What began as a united effort by the town government, an artist, and the town’s residents ended with a lasting reminder of the tension over this piece of art. The public enjoys works of art and the West Hartford Art League continues to advocate for more public art. In tough economic times, the Town Council weighs each penny of public money it spends, and that seems to be no different than it was 65 years ago. A Layman Looks at Schools in West Hartford Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, September 2003 Now, in a maturing society and a seething world we have come to recognize the imperative need for a wealth of wisdom added to a wealth of raw materials. We are looking to the schools, long accepted and long neglected, to supply citizens possessing greater foresight and leadership. – Bice Clemow, publisher West Hartford News, 1951 In 1950, Life Magazine published a 63 question test that rated public schools. School superintendents throughout the U.S. helped develop the survey. Bice Clemow, publisher of the West Hartford News, a parent and taxpayer in West Hartford, used the survey to rate each of West Hartford’s 13 public schools and all of the schools scored in the “average” range. Clemow found this distressing, as he considered West Hartford to be “an above average town.” He decided to study why the schools scored as average. Clemow saw improving schools as an answer to the “seething world” he refers to in his 1951 quote. In 1951, Truman was president, the Soviets had detonated an atomic bomb, Mao had won the civil war in China, the Korean War broke out and the Cold War was waging. Senator Joseph McCarthy alleged that there were communists in the State Department. Amidst these internal and external attacks on democracy, many Americans felt that the public school system was the place to build democracy and be sure that citizens knew what freedom was. The better the school system, it was thought, the better the citizen. West Hartford’s population grew from 24,941 to 33,776 between 1930 and 1940 and then to 44,402 by 1950. That represents a 76% increase in population in that 20 year span. Yet between 1931 and 1949 there were no new schools built. West Hartford Schools were at a space crisis in the 1940s and early 50s, and despite this, young families with children continued to move to the town. The pressure mounted on the Board of Education to build schools. In 1943, 5,265 students attended the public schools. By 1953, 8,507 attended public school, a 62% increase in 10 years. By 1958 the school population had doubled to 11,563. School children made up 15% of the population in 1943 and 19% of the population in 1958. Families with children chose to move to West Hartford. By 1951, Clemow believed that the townspeople needed to look a bit more closely at the public schools. He applied the categories of the Life survey by surveying the town’s school buildings, teachers, curriculum, and public opinion. His report, published in four installments from January 25 to February 15, seemed designed to drum up public interest in improving the schools. Clemow found that the facilities were kept clean, but, he found them lacking in public hygiene. The East and Whitman schools did not have provisions for students to wash their hands in the bathrooms and in many schools there was not reliable hot water or soap. He was very concerned with physical education – wanting there to be a gym and proper locker room facilities in each school. These did not exist except to a primitive extent in the high school. Each school had an auditorium, but some were too small to seat the whole school. The two new schools, Webster Hill and Bugbee, had auditoriums big enough to use as community facilities. He also found laboratory space to be “pitiful. In a scientific age, we are not measuring up at least in facilities… I am just saying that we haven’t a school plant – speaking of all 13 buildings – to match the homes along (to pick a street) Walbridge Road.” When assessing the role of teachers in the school system, Clemow believed that higher salaries would bring better teachers. In 1950, there were 250 teachers in the system. Teachers in 1950 started at $50 a week, or $2,000 per year. Top salary was $84 per week or $4,800 after 17 years of teaching and 6 years of college training. With the cost of living rising, Clemow argued, the town needed to match teacher salaries with equivalents to the business world. This would keep morale high among teachers. Top salary at that point for a teacher was, “something less than a bus driver makes.” West Hartford made Life’s minimum starting wage. Until the 1950s, the town believed that the secure nature of a teaching job was enough to keep teachers in town, but Clemow believed that promising security was not enough. The survey also pointed out shortcomings in teacher training. Clemow was concerned that it was difficult to graduate from a liberal arts college and go into teaching. The teachers colleges seemed to have a lock on teacher training in the 1940s and 1950s. Clemow supported a liberal arts education and continuing education in subject matter for teachers. Clemow also criticized the lack of a teacher evaluation system. As far as the curriculum was concerned, Clemow was upset by its traditional nature. He wrote, “…the classroom courses are as firmly rooted as Gibraltar.” He found that there had been less than a 10% change in the number of courses provided for students since 1940. He believed this was because of the tie between the high school curriculum and college admissions. Little was done to encourage the study of local government through real life experiences. And at the high school and junior high levels, Clemow believed there was too little interdisciplinary work. He believed the system did not do enough to recognize students as individuals. There was a 28 to 1 pupil to teacher ratio. The school system had developed a guidance program which did address the individual. Not enough was being done in physical education, but the health program was pretty good. The survey asked about extracurricular activities and Clemow found every school to be wanting except in the area of the music program which had shown “magnificent growth.” There was not an institutionalized program for parent teacher conferences but the Life survey suggested one. Clemow’s key for improving the schools lay with public advocacy. He did not see this happening in the town. In 1951, the Town Council appointed the Board of Education and few people even knew its five members. Very few citizens attended Board of Education meetings held every other Thursday evening. Clemow argued that the Board of Education reflected the individual views of its members, guided by the Superintendent, not by the citizenry. The Board was remote from the people. Clemow called for a democratically elected Board. He believed it was important that board members had children in the public schools. He said “I think it might be a shock to West Hartford parents if, going back over the last generation, they knew how some Board of Education members came to serve and how many of them with children in private institutions were blind to the second class quality of education in the public schools.” Clemow’s exposé spurred change. The town established a Citizens Committee to address these problems. It was difficult to get people to volunteer to sit on the committee. But in 1954 they published their report based around most of the issues that the Life survey raised. Clemow’s four articles written in 1951 seem to have been a wake up call to the town. In 5 years, the Board was democratically elected. By 1958, the Board and administration revised the curriculum to add honors classes in all areas in the high school and pushed more homogeneous groupings. The town built seven elementary schools between 1952 and 1959. The problems with teacher salaries continued to be a bone of contention and did not get addressed until teachers unionized in the mid-1960s. The tension between the four pillars of the school system, buildings, teachers, curriculum, and community involvement, still help determine the draw of West Hartford’s educational system within the Hartford region and throughout the country. West Hartford’s 1950s goal to be one of the top ten schools systems in the state led to more citizen involvement as together they strived to make the school system “above average” in an “above average” town. Teachers and their Role in the Town Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, January 2003 This town has been known for its outstanding schools since the late 1920s, with the building of the Beach Park School on Steele Road. As a teacher for 25 years in the town, I’ve always been interested in where that reputation came from. Quality education emanates from a combination of the actual buildings and environment within them, the teachers and their ideas, the administration and elected leadership on the Board of Education, and a supportive community that advocates for good schools. At times, these factors have worked in concert and at other times have been contentious. The late 1950s and early 1960s there were many disagreements because of an explosion in the size of the school system, a community wary about the costs, and a distrustful relationship between teachers, the administration and the Board of Education. Between 1940 and 1950, West Hartford’s population grew from 44,402 to 62,382, for a growth of 40%. The school system doubled in size as the town built and opened nine elementary schools, one junior high and one high school. Boosted by a booming economy, easy mortgages and federal housing loans, the town flourished by so many measures. In the consensus theory of history, so prevalent in the 1950s and 1960s, observers saw little conflict in the 1950s. Everyone enjoyed the economic boom, historians argued, and life was good for the thriving middle-class. This community reaped the benefits of this boom, but as in any change, benefits were not always distributed equally. Neither was conflict absent. Tensions between teachers, Board of Education members, the superintendent and taxpayers were palpable. In 1959, the Board of Education, just recently an elected body, commissioned a report on community-teacher relations. The Board appointed a committee of 15 people, 10 men and five women, to study the level of teachers’ salaries, teacher evaluation and methods of rewarding superior teachers. This committee’s job was to improve relations between the teachers and the townspeople. Between 1956 and 1959, the taxpayers were not so willing to support the school expansion with tax increases. Two referenda to increase the school budget came before the town voters and the voters defeated both. This led to dissatisfaction among the teachers and a decline in morale that, many argued, made it difficult for them to do their work. The Board of Education administered a survey among its teachers. The study was spawned by a 20% turnover rate among the 520 teachers in town at the end of the 1958-1959 school year. According to the survey given, only 29% of the teachers believed residents had respect for teachers and only 19% felt citizens appreciated what teachers did. Only 11% felt local citizens were sympathetic to teachers’ problems. More than half the teachers, 52%, believed they were receiving a poor salary, while 100% of the teachers said their job as a teacher was interesting. The Board of Education, the superintendent and the teachers showed concern about why they left: the general feeling among teachers was that they were leaving because salaries were so low. In 1959, 60% of the teachers had fewer than three years of experience in the five years previous, there was also a turnover of about 20% each year. Statements made in the report like “the board in its communications with teachers ought to give due consideration to the fact that it is dealing with a group of professionally trained personnel” smacked of a contentious relationship. In 1959, a new teacher earned $4,150. The highest paid teacher, after 14 years of service, earned $6,800. Teachers earned about $200 a year more for each year they served. In 2002, teachers of the top of the salary schedule, after 16 years of service, make twice the starting salary of about $36,000. In the 1950s, there was a strong anti-union fervor in the country. The wild days of the 1930s, encouraged by the Wagner Act which made employers bargain with unions and the great gains labor made in the 1940s, were curtailed by the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. This act established an 80-day cooling off period before a union could go on strike, forbade federal workers from striking, made union members take oaths that they were not members of the Communist Party, and allowed businesses to sue unions that went on strike for breach of contract. Many residents seemed to share these anti-union feelings. During the Kennedy Administration, by Executive Order, JFK allowed for public employees to join unions. This led to teachers thinking more about their rights. As a requirement to receive her paycheck, a recently retired West Hartford teacher remembers being asked to sign a pledge in the early 1960s that she would not go on strike. The West Hartford Education Association represented the teachers at the time, but it was not an official bargaining unit. In fact, the report stated, “the use of tactics resembling those of a teachers’ union as a bargainer for teachers is not likely to obtain understanding or sympathy in the eyes of the community.” It was not until 1965 that Connecticut’s General Assembly passed a fair dismissal law that legislated due-process rights for public school teachers. This included passage of Connecticut’s collective bargaining law that mandated negotiation of teacher contracts. But for local teachers, this was still six years away. Those on the Citizens Committee on Community-Teacher Relations seemed to support President Eisenhower’s belief that the United States, and West Hartford, should be a cooperative society in which major groups such as business, teachers and taxpayers could put aside their special interests to promote domestic harmony and economic stability. The committee believed it could act as an arbiter to bring together the excessive special interests and restrain demands of the teachers while continuing to provide an excellent education for its children. The committee was upset with how the WHEA had represented teachers in the 1958-59 school year. The WHEA wanted to foster good community relations, improve teachers’ status and improve teachers’ sense of professionalism, but the committee argued “that these aims have suffered seriously during the last 12 months as a result of tactics employed by the Association… It would seem that the WHEA should refrain from careless use of statistics, from the use of oral and written emotional statements and from attempting to bring excessive pressure to bear in the interest of a parent unanimity (among teachers).” This barrage of statistics and invectives seem to be the only way teachers could get the board’s and the public’s attention before there was collective bargaining. One source of dissatisfaction among teachers was the use of a merit system of pay. Only 12% of teachers found satisfactory the present method of selecting teachers to receive the double increment merit awards. It was not clear to teachers what criteria were used to select teachers and if it was defined, teachers seemed not to know what it was. Teachers made known that favoritism by principals and a supposed cap on the number of teachers selected (which seemed to be one per school) led to much dissension among the teachers. The report notes that a committee of the administration and the WHEA were working on this. It is easy for us teachers and taxpayers today to think this contention is all in the past. In 2002, when many residents see their property values tied closely to the high-quality educational system in town, many of these concerns seem so old. But, look back just to 1994-95 when the schools were last redistricting to see a downturn in public satisfaction with the schools. The present upsurge in support for the school system and the influx of people with children to town show our educational system to be an attractive lure to West Hartford. But the political tide can change and with the new federal education bill promising to name some of this town’s schools as failing, how will the teachers, the administrators and the taxpayers react? How Should We Celebrate our Sesquicentennial? Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, September 2002 When I moved to Outlook Avenue nine years ago, the previous owners left behind a black iron trivet which reads West Hartford Conn., 1854-1954 surrounding an imprint of the then Town Hall with the Noah Webster statue in front. I knew this trivet commemorated the centennial celebration of our town, but I have just recently discovered that this trivet was just a small reminder of the community-wide centennial week celebration for West Hartford’s residents from June 6 to 12, 1954. The Kiwanis Club sold these trivets for a dollar and used the proceeds for their Kiwanis Child Welfare Fund. Reading about the events of West Hartford’s centennial makes me think about how West Hartford might celebrate its sesquicentennial that is less than two years away. Planning for the centennial celebration began in 1950, four years before the celebration, when H.M. Feine, executive secretary of the West Hartford Chamber of Commerce called for a meeting of those interested, and Everett Dow, the Town Clerk encouraged townspeople to join up. The planners wanted a weeklong celebration at which they could define who they were as a town through their history and pageantry. A news article in the Hartford Times on February 2, 1950 depicts the town as “referred to once as the ‘bedroom’ of Hartford, the town has rapidly outgrown that name and is today one of the wealthiest residential cities in the United States with a population well over 45,000.” Planning moved apace and by October 1953, the planners chartered the West Hartford Historical Society. By March 1954, more than 150 townspeople worked on 18 committees preparing for the celebration. The Centennial Commission coordinated the event. Clarence C. Boyce, the just retired president of the West Hartford Trust Company (now Fleet Bank), chaired the executive committee that included Mayor C. Edwin Carlson, Town Clerk Everett D. Dow, Town Manager Rodney Loomis, Leo Golden, Clarence Seymour, and U.S. Senator William Purtell, a West Hartford resident and business executive from Holo-Krome Screw Corporation. Purtell was the Honorary Chairman of the committee. The 17 other committees included Reception, Chamber of Commerce, Program, Religious, Souvenirs, Public Information, Pageant, Dinner to Town Officials, Woman’s, Finance, Historical, Elmwood, Sports, Class Reunion, Speakers, Parade, and West Hartford Garden Clubs. Women served on just five committees: the Woman’s Pageant, Historical, Class Reunion, Parade and Garden Clubs. This was a people’s celebration reflecting as much about life in the 1950s as is did our past. A historical pageant was the centerpiece of the celebration with 1,2000 students from the 15 public schools playing roles. Teachers Marjorie Rice from Sedgwick, and Ruth Tower from Morley wrote the script. The pageant committee included the two teachers, the curriculum coordinator for the school system, the director of elementary education, and music and art teachers. The Practical Arts teacher at Hall, Miss Catherine Stevenson and each PTO arranged for parents to sew 500 costumes using $2,000 worth of cloth. This pageant drew an audience of 13,000 people over its two-night run. This history pageant was the centerpiece of the Centennial celebration in 1954. Note the map of West Hartford as the backdrop. 1,200 students from 15 public schools played roles. Over 13,000 people viewed the pageant in its two night run. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society The West Hartford Armory on Farmington Avenue hosted an Exposition with 80 booths displaying West Hartford business and industry. This exhibit gave the “people of West Hartford an opportunity to see a visual display of the valuable contribution that local industry and business make to the Town, State and Nation,” according to Edward M. Flannery, chairman of the Centennial Exposition committee. This “progress exposition” included local industrial concerns, retail representatives from the Chamber of Commerce, West Hartford Schools, Girl Scouts, local merchants, the West Hartford Art League, Children’s Museum, and several Hartford insurance companies. Historical and needlework exhibits opened at Webster Hall in the public library. The historical exhibit included pictures, furniture, documents, silver and china, and models of old West Hartford landmarks. The needlework exhibit displayed various styles and methods used by women over the past 100 years. These exhibits were free and open all week. The program began on June 6 in the churches and synagogues of the town. At all church services on that Sunday, the commission wanted a special mention of West Hartford’s early beginnings based on religious convictions and a desire to form a fundamentally sound community. Nelson Burr, historian in the Library of Congress, and later West Hartford’s Town Historian, addressed a crowd of 200 on Sunday night at the First Church of Christ Congregational. Governor John Lodge extended a tribute to West Hartford on behalf of the state from the First Church pulpit. President Eisenhower sent a congratulatory proclamation read that evening. On Monday night, a committee sponsored a dinner at the parish house of the First Church to honor the founders of the town. Tuesday night’s dinner at Rockledge was for town officials both past and present. A guest speaker, Edmund H. Harding from North Carolina, noted as a “tar-heel humorist,” entertained the crowd. Charles B. Beach, whose family donated Beachland Park and the Beach Park School to town, was master of ceremonies. The Sports Committee arranged an outdoor basketball game at the Duffy School between Hall and New Britain High on Monday night. Sports events continued through the week with a track meet at Sterling Field on Tuesday night featuring Lindy Remigino who had just won his Olympic gold medal two years before. According to the program, several other nationally known athletes competed as well. On the last day of the celebration there was sports day at the Hall High fields including a baseball game between Hall and East Hartford High and a softball game between the Aetna Life Girls Team and the Travelers Girls Team. Little League games were scheduled throughout the town on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday nights. Elmwood wanted to be sure to be included in the celebration and the VFW planned a Children’s Day on the Lincoln Dairy grounds east of the underpass on New Britain Avenue. The Elmwood Community Church decorated four rooms in “1850 style” for residents to visit. Friday night at 7 p.m. the parade kicked off in the center with 21 floats and 12 bands. At the conclusion of the parade, the West Hartford Square Dancers hosted a festival at Sterling Field from 8:30 to 11:00. The week was capped off with a Saturday night fireworks display at Sterling Field. The Centennial parade stepped off at 7 p.m. on Friday, June 11, 1954 with 21 floats and 12 bands. Square dancing at Sterling Field followed the parade. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. How should we get as many townspeople involved as were 50 years ago and how, in the 21st century will we choose to depict our “priceless heritage” and our “challenging future?” In 1954, town officials, schools, recreation department, Chamber of Commerce, local industries, and the newly formed historical society were an integral part of both supplying the money and the time for planning the celebration. Six years ago, the Town Council put some seed money in the budget to get the plans moving, but those moneys have not been forthcoming over the last few years. Let’s get moving! What Was This Town Like Back in 1954? Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, October 2002 I spend time thinking about what makes this town unique. I ask the juniors and seniors in my local history class at Conard High School on their first day of class what a newcomer to the town should know about West Hartford and, at the beginning of the course, they usually come up with Noah Webster and the school system. By the time the course is over, they learn about the panoply of architecture, the agricultural, industrial and suburban character of our town as its nature ebbed and flowed over time, about tensions in town over racial integration, school redistricting and highway building. They see a town where democracy works and how the town manager system has effectively matured from 1919 when it was the first such system in Connecticut. They see a town that is proud of itself and reflective on its heritage. Which parts of this heritage will we choose to highlight in our sesquicentennial celebration in 2004? Looking at what was said at the centennial in 1954 could be a guide. So what was the 1954 message proclaimed during a time of tremendous growth in the town and during the Cold War? In 1954, tensions abounded in town. The first study of an east-west Highway (I-84) in 1948 was still being debated six years later as engineers in the town continued to fight about the best path through town. Hall High School was opened in 1926 when the population of the town ahd about 15,000 people. Hall was so overcrowded by 1950, when the population reached 44,000, that discussions about a new high school raised tensions. When Frederick U. Conard, head of the Board of Education, died in 1954, the town had agreed to build a new high school, but it did not open for another three years after rancorous debate about the proper site, size and attendance zones. Controversy raged about what to do with the World War II housing built on Oakwood Avenue where Kennedy Park is today. Even though the plan was to knock the temporary housing down after the war, the shortage of housing, especially for veterans and their families, caused many to believe it should stay. Townspeople lined up for and against razing the old Town Hall, the old building of the First Church which was in a state of disrepair and which the late town historian Nelson Burr said in his 1954 centennial speech, “I hope will never be torn down.” What did Burr say about the town in his commemorative address in 1954? He did use dissent and independence as themes to tie his message together, but for the most part, his address was celebratory in praising the sense of community and the exceptional nature of the town. His address, given on June 6, 1954 at the First Church of Christ, Congregational, was printed and published as “Three Centuries of a Yankee Town.” He started by extolling the dynamic energy of the town’s founders. He felt that was reflected in 1954 in the youth in town. Two thirds of the town’s population was under 45 years of age and almost half were under 35. He saw this as a sign of “hopeful people” and of an “expectant spirit.” He continued that “independence was and is in West Hartford’s blood.” The accepted belief that the residents’ desire for their own church in the West Division in 1710 was based on the distance from Hartford, but he believed it was based more on their “wish to handle their own business” than on geography. Residents could elect their own minister and teacher, who they looked up to as “a better educated neighbor, not in fear as to servile agents of the feudal lord.” Burr argued that dissent was essential to understanding the town. It started with establishing the church in 1713 and continued with dissenters from that church. In 1794, Quakers broke away to set up a Society of Friends. In 1843, Episcopalians established the church and in 1858, the Baptists built a church in the center. He was impressed by the 153 seceders who signed the petition for independence in 1854 and the 95 who voted against secession. Among those who signed the petitions were Irish, German and Swedish immigrants who began to break the hold of the English majority. Here, Burr mused, was independence in the presence of dissent. Burr argued that the town was founded on four principles that he called the “cornerstones of our civilization”: The right of individual property in land and homes which lead to a greater social equality than Europe and was the cornerstone of popular government. Religious liberty to administer our own church affairs. The sovereignty of a righteous God who made people morally responsible to God and their neighbor. The necessity of an educated citizenry to administer church and state and then the need for democratic schooling, generously supported. He spent the rest of his address giving examples of how West Hartford lived out these tenets. Noah Webster, he argued, exemplified many of these ideas. In the last part of his speech he characterized the town in the 20th century, first as three separate villages which didn’t always agree on schools, churches and fire districts. He catalogued the change of the rural town as mansions began to be built on the Eastside after the Civil War and we began to “suburbanize.” Outside of the east side and the southeast industrial section, the town remained rural. Burr argued that by 1920, these differences had been washed away with the wave of “suburbanization.” Localism, he said, became meaningless as the school districts unified, one high school was built, fire districts merged, and the town manager system of government took hold. He believed that religious and ethnic changes were “harmoniously accepted” and West Hartford became “an example of American suburbia at its best.” This consensus interpretation of West Hartford’s past, so prevalent among historians in the 1950s, glossed over many of the tensions which also make this a unique town. Those tensions over schools, low-income housing, architectural heritage and traffic eliminate the heart and soul of the town searching to define itself. What will the planners of the sesquicentennial think about over the next two years? Will they provide a forum for us to think about traffic problems, the racial imbalance in the town’s elementary schools, or the issue of whether elected officials could more closely reflect the rich diversity of the town? Will this be balanced with the celebration of the architectural richness of the town, of the amazing retail transformation of the town center over the past 50 years or of the continued excellence of its schools? Community in the West Division Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, April 2004 How does a town develop its sense of community? How often do citizens interact? What parts of town are exclusive and what parts are open to all? In a town of 63,000 residents, how often does the whole town come together? The town’s sesquicentennial celebration in May and June 2004, will provide a time for members from different areas of the community to come together for a parade, a picnic, an art day, an historical scavenger hunt, a public history day and finally a fireworks celebration. Six garden clubs are planting sesquicentennial flower beds and the Faxon Library is hosting an ice cream social. None of these activities costs money for the participants and they invite all to come and enjoy. How else is this sense of community built in our town and how has this changed over time? Our public schools, public parks, public hearings, libraries, streets and roads are open to all. Some institutions are semi-exclusive like churches and synagogues which people join. Cornerstone Pool, the Veterans Memorial Skating Rink, the Science Museum, Boy and Girl Scouts, and sports leagues all allow anyone in, but each of us chooses our spots and pays to participate. Then there are exclusive places which have tests of money or skill for membership like private country clubs, and private and parochial schools where each of us define our community in a more specific and exclusive way that can make a large community like West Hartford feel smaller. What common experiences did all West Division residents have 230 years ago when Noah Webster was alive? Have we built on these building blocks? Until 1754, the West Division had a “common” area of land that stretched from Quaker Lane to Prospect Avenue. Farmers grazed their livestock and cut wood for building houses, for fences, and for firewood. By 1754, however, the land became so valuable that it was divided and doled out to individuals. Noah Webster, Sr. received three acres from “the common” in that year. This symbolized a declining sense of community and the rise of individualism. The tensions between the private good of the individual and the common good still remain today. There was but one church in town and in 1774, the meeting house sat at the northwest corner of Main Street and Farmington Avenue. A list of “members in full communion” in 1764 listed 130 members (out of a population of about 1,000). Men, women and “negroes” could be church members. Church membership and attendance were open to all and, whether you attended or not, you paid tax money to the church. A keen sense of community is built when people live where they work. In the West Division, almost everyone was a farmer and each farmer who owned land had a real stake in the community. Land records from the 1770s show a great amount of buying and selling activity to consolidate land holdings. They also reveal how much contact there was between neighbors. Noah Webster, Sr.’s land sales show him making 26 transactions from 1740 to 1813. Most of his land was bought between 1740 and 1769. He bought the pieces of land from eight different people with three transactions from his brother Daniel Webster who lived across the street on South Main. At his peak, it is likely that Noah Webster, Sr. owned about 80 acres. Historians believe having 50 acres of land in colonial New England would make a middle class farmer. The land transaction records show that the land that Noah Webster, Sr. bought and sold seemed to consolidate his holdings; the land was bordered by the land of 28 different households in the West Division. In the 1770s, farmers were careful about their land borders and often had to build fences to demarcate the land and keep their livestock separate from others’ crops. Watching out for their land took the cooperation of all those with whom they bordered. While the farms were here in the West Division, one day a week in season, farmers traveled four miles east to Hartford to trade their goods. Farmers hitched their horses to wagons and made the trek to market. This became a community activity, mostly for men, but several times a year women and children joined them. Neither John Whitman nor Zaccheus Butler had stores in town in the 1770s, but they did serve as centers of trade. Their account books show the interdependence of town residents and the trading that went on here. They traded farm goods for imports such as brandy, rum, silk, and the services of both people and animals. Those who owned bulls or horses studded them. People lent their horses for trips into Hartford. Day’s labor is recorded. Each of these transactions was established at a set price and each included an interaction between those with the goods and services, the middle man, and those who wanted to buy the goods and services. Buying and selling brought the community together. No one was self-sufficient, and no transaction could be made without a conversation. In 1774, everyday life took on a political nature as colonists protested the actions of the British toward their colonies when the Parliament imposed the Intolerable Acts on Boston. After the First Continental Congress met in 1774, the Hartford town meeting decided to support non-importation. Community members chose to sacrifice individual needs and comfort for the common good. The four taverns in town became hubs of political discourse. Women gathered for spinning bees as they joined in to make homespun cloth. The activity surrounding Patriot protests provided leadership opportunities for more residents. Leaders coordinated activities in the West Division with those in the other colonies, particularly Boston. Hartford also established a Committee of Safety. Members watched their neighbors to see if they were following the non-importation, non-consumption resolutions which the town meeting supported. The outside force, Britain, led to a stronger sense of community, but also led to tensions within the community between Patriots and Loyalists. Because the West Division had only about 150 residences and about 1,000 residents in 1774, developing a sense of community must have been easier than in a town of 63,000 in 2004. While the difference economically was growing by 1774, there were not many divisions in daily living. There were one room school houses, one church, and a local militia which were open to all. Everyone could trade, including “negroes” and widows. It would have been difficult to live an isolated existence and though transportation was not as easy, there was a great deal of movement and interaction, making the town a community with its own identity. By the 1790s, already residents petitioned the General Assembly to be an independent town. As West Hartford plans to celebrate itself at this spring’s Sesquicentennial, there is a chance once again to reflect on our identity as a community. There is only one other town in Connecticut, which has as high a percentage of its residents working in the town as outside of town. Just like the farmers of old, West Hartford residents have a real stake in the community. Tensions always exist around budget time over how much personal income we should justly give in taxes for town services for the common good. What type of community do these tensions help to define? Residents today are much more numerous and diverse than 230 years ago; the Sesquicentennial is an opportunity for all of us to come together to enjoy activities that make our community a place to celebrate. King Philip: Why Did We Name a School After Him? Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, August 2002 According to Harvard historian Jill Lepore, in her book The Name of War: King Philip’s War and the Origins of American Identity (1998), the war was “always brutal and everywhere fierce” and it “proved to be not only the most fatal war in all of American history, but also one of the most merciless.” Why, then, did our town, in 1955, name a school after the Wampanoag Indian King Philip? The war devastated both Native and English settlers from 1675 to 1676, with casualties greater than any other war in American history in proportion to population. The simple answer, according to a Board of Education action in 1955, was to change the name of the King Philip Drive school to the King Philip school. It was named after the street on which it was located. But why would a real estate developer choose King Philip, also known as Metacomet, as someone to honor in the 1950s? Why a Wampanoag Country Club? Why Mohegan, Seminole, Pontiac and Tecumseh Drives? This fascination with Indians and what they represent begs some historical investigation. King Philip’s War began in June 1675 in southeastern Massachusetts after the English settlers hanged three Wampanoag men by the neck not far from Plymouth Rock. These three men, loyal to Philip, the sachem or chief of the Wampanoag, were accused of killing John Sassamon, a fellow Wampanoag. According to Metacomet’s men, Sassamon betrayed the Wampanoag plan to wage war on the English settlers. A jury of 12 Englishmen and six Christian Indians convicted these Wampanoag men of murder. By the end of June, Philip and his men began attacking English towns to try to reassert their control in New England. They attacked three towns in Connecticut, the closest to us being Simsbury, burned to the ground in 1676. Legend has it that King Philip hid in a cave on Talcott Mountain just below where people hang glide off the cliff today. The Nipmucks, Pocumtucks, Narragansetts and Abenakis joined the Wampanoags at various times, depending upon local disputes and Native alliances which had a long history. From June 1675 to August 1676, Philip and his men devastated 25 English towns, more than half of all colonial settlements in New England. In 18 months, 2,500 English soldiers and civilians were killed, about 5% of the colonial population. The Wampanoags slaughtered more than 8.000 cattle. The Wampanoags were fierce in their determination to get back the land the English settlers had taken from them over the previous 55 years. At the same time, the war proved to be disastrous for the Wampanoags. The settlers killed both soldiers and civilians in their attempts to take land from the Wampanoags and their Pequot and Mohegan allies. Five thousand Native peoples, as much as 40% of the estimated population, were killed. Thousands more died of disease or starvation or were shipped out of the colonies and enslaved in the Caribbean. Even those who attempted to assimilate by converting to Christianity were removed from their towns and kept on barren islands, where many died. From the accounts written by English settlers in the 1670s, right after the war, there seems little reason to name the school after King Philip. These first historians portrayed him as a brutal, irrational, uncivilized man. The colonial militia beheaded him at the end of the war, and quartered his body so it could be displayed in four places. His head was kept at Plymouth on a pole for 20 years. English settlers certainly saw Philip as a vicious, threatening foe. For 40 years, Phillip’s father and Wampanoag sachem Massasoit maintained a stable relationship with the English, but those peaceful relations deteriorated quickly after his death. As more and more English settlements became permanent, the Wampanoags were being pushed off their land and they realized their way of life was endangered. During Phillip’s 14 years as Wampanoag sachem, the Plymouth colonists with whom he remained uncomfortably allied, mistreated him and his people. Philip was concerned that Massasoit had given up so much land to the English. He noted that land was taken unfairly, through written documents, and if the English did not get enough land, they let their cattle roam Indian land, or they negotiated with Indians after supplying them with liquor. Philip also disliked John Eliot’s praying Indians, those who had been converted to Christianity. There were 14 praying towns in Massachusetts. Philip believed this religious conversion was a dangerous thing and knew that the Christianized Indians were subject to the English king and not their own. They also were under the aegis of the English courts. In 1836, William Apess, a Pequot who was the first to write about Philip in a positive light, claimed that Philip was opposed to attacking the English. He wrote that his young warriors were out of his control. He quoted Philip saying “brothers, these people from the unknown world will cut down our groves, spoil our hunting and planting grounds, and drive us and our children from the graves of our fathers, and our council fires, and enslave our women and children.” Philip was a man who stood up for his culture, according to Apess, and believed that assimilation was destroying his people. There were values in his culture, he believed, worth dying for. Philip fought to defend the rights of his people. Apess also said “we find Philip as active as the wind, as dexterous as a giant, firm as the pillows of heaven, and fierce as a lion, a powerful foe to contend with indeed, and as swift as an eagle gathering together his forces to prepare them for the battle.” Philip was kind to his prisoners, including captive Mary Rowlandson who wrote a captivity narrative. Apess portrays Philip as a man who understood the English’s devastation to Indians from despoiling the forest and hunting grounds, digging up their dead, taking away the Indian’s leadership, their enslavement, and all their rights taken away. Philip’s was the voice that said this oppression and destruction was wrong. Apess, who wrote around the time of the Trail of Tears, encouraged Native Peoples in the 1830s to “seize the mantle of liberty… We want trumpets that sound like thunder, and men to act as though they were going at war with those corrupt and degrading principles that robs one of all rights merely because he is ignorant and a little different color. Let us have principles that will give everyone his due; and then shall wars cease, and the weary find rest.” Apess called Philip “the greatest man that was ever in America.” So, from Apess’ point of view, King Philip represented values that many of us accept today as American values: to stand up against wrongs, to support liberty, and to believe that all people deserve respect. It is not clear that the real estate developers or the Board of Education had these ideals in mind when they named the school. Naming a school after King Philip can make us think about our fascination with war and war heroes. Which side in war deserves our compassion? How do we reconcile our idealistic disdain for war and yet our continued willingness to fight? Extreme conditions often make us think of the essence of the human condition and what it is that makes us human. The words of Apess can give us a sense of why King Philip was a hero and see why his qualities could be emulated. King Philip’s actions in war can also make us question why the Board of Education chose this name. Olivia Shelton, African-American Pioneer Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, June 2003 When Olivia and Clarence Shelton and their two children moved to 178 North Main Street in 1959, the man next door offered them $5,000 not to move there. This African American family crossed the housing boundary and some West Hartford residents did not like it. Olivia and Clarence Shelton moved to this house at 178 North Main Street in 1959. Though real estate agents tried to discourage them from buying the home by telling them there were termites and water in the basement, they went ahead and bought the house and lived there until 1994. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. In 1997, West Hartford resident Dorothy Billington interviewed Olivia Shelton when she was 87 years old. In that year, members of the West Hartford Historical Society took oral histories about members of our community whose stories may never hit the history books. These remembrances, now transcribed, offer a unique perspective into the past in our town which, when set in the context of their times, illuminate the character of our suburb. Olivia Glascoe (1910-2001) was born on a farm in the small town of Franklinton, North Carolina. Her father rented land as a tenant farmer and they picked cotton. They raised cows and pigs. Olivia had aspirations and ambitions beyond the farm. She graduated from Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina and went on to get a Master’s Degree in Education from Columbia University. At Columbia she lived in the International House where she had contact with people from all over the world. Living in this house was probably not Olivia’s choice, but more likely, was a way Columbia segregated its dormitories. After her studies at Columbia, Olivia taught school for eight years in North Carolina before marrying her husband Lt. Col. Clarence Byrd Shelton in 1942. From 1942 to 1944 they lived in Seattle and her first son, Clarence Jr. was born; they moved to Hartford in 1945. When the Sheltons first came to Hartford, the Board of Education would only hire Olivia as a substitute teacher for three years, despite her teaching experience, her Ivy League education, and principal’s certificate. Why? Shelton replied, “Because I was black! I’m positive it was because I was black.” She took two or three years off when she had her second son and then decided to go back to teaching. Hartford did not hire her at this point. She appealed to Reverend Moody, one of the first black members of Hartford’s Board of Education, and he got a job for her. This part of Shelton’s story reveals that segregation still existed in New England well after World War II. Many historians argue that World War II was a watershed for the civil rights movement because of the Fair Employment Practices Commission established by Franklin Roosevelt after much pressure from A. Phillip Randolph, a national leader of the African American community. However, as often is the case, practice was slow to follow this policy change. The Sheltons rented a three-family home on Oakland Terrace in Hartford for their home from 1947 to 1959. They owned a farm in Burlington, Connecticut from about 1947 to the mid 1950s and spent their summers on the farm. Many friends and relatives visited. They had a huge garden, a large pond for swimming, and a barn with horses for riding. Her niece remembered many happy days there in the summer. Later, the Sheltons bought a Maine lake house with a number of other couples. Olivia Shelton and her family moved to West Hartford in 1959 and lived in their 5 bedroom, 3½ bath Tudor on North Main Street for 35 years. Their second son Brent was 10 when they moved to West Hartford in 1959. He was the first black student to attend Bugbee school. Brent joined Cub Scouts and his den mother was G. Fox’s Beatrice Fox Auerbach’s daughter Georgette Koopman who lived nearby on Brookside Boulevard. Olivia said, “Brent made out alright, because at Bugbee, this lady took him in. He was friendly with her son… The people treated him alright. They didn’t dare treat him any other way because of Mrs. Auerbach… She owned G.Fox and Company. That made a difference.” For Olivia, her positive experiences outweighed the prejudice she faced. Right after she moved in, she found a note in her mailbox which read “get out of here, you black bastards, while you still can.” She believed “that note did not represent the community.” At 87, Olivia’s recalled that she was happy she got the note before her sons, and that her overwhelming experience in West Hartford was “very good and wholesome.” She felt fine living on North Main Street, and said “Most of the people there are Jewish and they were nice to us.” Olivia joined the First Church of Christ in 1961 and she taught third grade Sunday School for 12 years. The Sheltons were the only black family in the church. She was appointed a Deacon at the church as well. Olivia volunteered as a clerk in the gift shop one day a week at the Science Museum. She also served as the president of the Hartford Chapter of the National Council of Negro Women. She was also one of the founders of the West Hartford African American Social and Cultural Organization. In the summer of 1967, she trained to be a teacher for Project Concern. She was a Hartford teacher sent to work at Smith and Wolcott for a year. When she moved to the McAuley in 1994, she was the first black resident. She lived on the edges and could go between cultures. She said that she lived a happy life as a pioneer. Oral historians must be careful of their sources, and particularly of reminiscences of life. In a 1973 West Hartford News article, Olivia had quite a different take on her life here in West Hartford. Though in 1997, she did talk about the problems her sons had in school once they were in junior high and high school, she summed up her life here as very positive. In 1973, she told the News that there was a lot of “pettiness” here. Real estate agents told them that there were termites and water in the basement in certain houses so that they wouldn’t buy one in a white neighborhood. She said that the treatment made her so upset that after they moved in, they would attend real estate open houses in various neighborhoods “just for meanness and devilment . . .to scare the people.” She said in 1973, “I don’t like to pretend to put forth that all is well – I’m sure that you’ll run into that, interviewing other black families.” She said that her oldest son Clarence “caught hell in high school.” He went to Conard. “The girls loved him but the fathers hated him. They gave him a hard time. Every time he looked around, the police were after him.” High school was “terrible for him.” They sent their second son to Watkinson hoping to protect him somewhat, but that was tough for him as well. Residents of West Hartford struggled with the reality of an integrated community. Though African Americans had lived here from the 18th century, and are clearly here in the early 20th century, segregation seems to have increased in the 1930s and 1940s, until it was a noticeable event to have a black family move in in the 1950s. Between 1959 and 1973, 39 black families, a total of 265 African American people out of a population of 70,000 settled in West Hartford. Some were helped by the Connecticut Council of Churches which worked to get black families to move to the suburbs. The 1973 News article made the point that many of these families were upper income and the greatest proportion lived in the Aiken school district. But, the tension over what our community was remained. There were many, like Georgette Koopman, who embraced the idea of a multi-racial community and that relationships of one individual made a difference. Then there were those afraid of difference who tried to make people like the Sheltons question their right to live in the town. Tensions over living in a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, and multi-religious community are played out in neighborhoods and schools every day as we attempt to live out the promise of the American Dream. The Political and Economic Landscape in 1957 Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, April 2007 The political year 1957 began with a salvo from the Republican Town Chairman Samuel K. Lavery, accusing the Democrats on the Town Council of “violating the spirit of the town charter” and he threatened court action. Lavery claimed he needed to take court action “to teach the Democrat members of the Council the meaning of democracy and minority representation.” The Democrats appointed Republicans to the Board of Assessors and the Board of Tax Review who had not been nominated by the Republican Party. While the Democrats followed the letter of the law by insuring minority representation, the Republican Party had no part in their appointments. Republicans had controlled the town of West Hartford since its independence from Hartford in 1854. It was 101 years later in 1955 when Democrats first took control following a tax referendum. Harold Keith became the first Democratic Mayor. Keith named a new Town Manager, Donald Blatt in 1956, and Republicans, though having a 2 to 1 majority in voter registration, had to play the role of minority party for the first time ever. When historians look at the past, they see it both in a mirror and through a window. Some events look very different. Others seem so similar to the present day that we see ourselves perfectly in the looking glass of the “old days.” Fifty years ago, West Hartford was in one of its greatest spurts of growth economically, educationally, and in population. The town government reacted by electing its Board of Education for the first time and asking to raise the mill rate by 6 ½ mills after a 0 mill increase the year before. Two schools were opened as residential growth continued to skyrocket. It was bound to be a year full of controversy and contention in a mostly small “d” democratic town. The grand list grew almost 7% from 1956 to 1957. The main factor in the grand list increase, according to the Hartford Courant, was the addition of 187 homes in Elmwood Acres housing project just south of Route 84 and east of Mayflower Street. These homes, built by the federal government during World War II as war worker housing, were sold to individual owners in 1956, adding over $1 million worth of property to the grand list. New homes, numbering 572, were also added to the list. Economically, the town grew fast residentially, commercially and industrially over the course of 1956. Total undeveloped land in town dropped from about 4,756 acres to 4,351 acres, a drop of about 9%. Commercial and retail buildings numbered 414, an increase of 27 buildings or a 7% increase. There were 98 factories, 12 more than the previous year, and an increase of 14%. In 1957, the town counted 12 horses and mules. There were 83 head of cattle, the herd growing by 5 in the past year. The town budget was $10 million (compared to about $200 million in 2007) and a population of around 60,000, equal to today’s. The education budget made up less than half of the total budget (compared to about 60% today). The education budget went up 20% in one year while the remainder of the budget increased by 36%. The town continued to build its infrastructure including paving seven miles of roads, completing Trout Brook Drive from Fern to Asylum, constructing 19 miles of sidewalks, providing money to lower Trout Brook, building hardtop tennis courts at Fern Park, and improving the golf course at Buena Vista Park. There was one million dollars for the construction of Wolcott School; money for Cornerstone Pool that was set to be built on 3.6 acres owned by the town on Raymond Road, and where a new park will be built after Blue Back Square construction is completed. The budget called for a 2% raise for employees to match inflation. It also had money to employ 23 men to operate the new incinerator expected to go into operation in the summer on Brixton Road. There was also an increase in interest to pay on the bonds floated for the numerous school building projects over the previous eight years. This budget called for a 6 ½ mill increase, 10% increase in taxes, the biggest single tax rate increase in West Hartford’s history. When a large increase was presented in 1955, citizens called for a referendum and defeated the budget. There was no increase in the mill rate in 1956. Ozzie D’Arche, who instigated the successful 1955 referendum, lay in wait. Democrat Mayor Keith claimed that one of the main reasons for the increase was a past when the government spent only the absolute minimum without regard for future growth. His budget included a three-year plan for growth. He argued that if school building projects had been planned, the town could have avoided double sessions and decreased costs of site acquisitions. The previous year’s budget had not increased. Public feedback showed the public would not stand for more than a 4 ½ mill increase instead of the 6 ½ mill increase proposed. D’Arche led the charge to rein in on town spending and he and the memory of the 1955 referendum that led to a change in political leadership reined in the budget. On January 22, 1,200 townspeople went to a hearing at King Philip School to weigh in on the budget. After lobbying and meetings and a reappraisal of the budget, the Council settled on a 2 ¾ mill increase for the year, down from the original 6 ½ mills. The municipal election, then held on Tuesday April 2, was a show of confidence for the Democrats, returning a 4-3 majority on the council. All four Democrats were re-elected, including Mayor Harold Keith. In 1957, townspeople voted in seven districts for their Town Councilor. In the Third District, anti-tax man Ozzie D’Arche ran as an independent in a three-way race, with the Republican winning the open seat with twice as many votes as either the Democratic opponent or D’Arche. Republicans won the Board of Education with a 5 to 2 split. With a Republican registration double that of Democrats, the results were something of a surprise. Active West Hartford citizens were ever present to check the power of the local government, just as they have been over the last 50 years. They made sure that townspeople knew how much the economic base of the town grew in the previous year and tried to keep a cap on spending. The elected Democratic officials and the Town Manager believed that townspeople had to be willing to pay for the services provided. That is, if they expected excellent schools and recreation, it would cost more to live here than it did in other towns. This voice of the citizens is what keeps elected government mindful of “democracy and minority representation.” A strong minority party, a growing economy, and an active, educated citizenry remain the keys to a healthy town. Conard High School Celebrates 50 Years Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, November 2006 This school year, Conard celebrates its 50th year. 15,000 students have graduated from the school and many choose to live in West Hartford and raise their children here. What was the school like 50 years ago? With the tremendous growth in the town population after World War II, there was talk in the late 1940s of the need for a new high school in town. Hall High School opened in 1924 and was built for 700 students. In the next 25 years, the town grew from about 10,000 to 44,000 people. The last new school built was Sedgwick which opened in 1931. By the late 1940s Hall had over 1000 students in three grades. After much discussion about adding on to Hall in the center of town, the appointed Board of Education decided in early 1954 to build a new high school on a site in the south end of town. Chairman of the Board of Education, Frederick U. Conard led the Board to this decision over his seven year tenure as Chair. The year he started as Chair, 1947, was the same time he became president of Niles Bement Pond Company, a part of Pratt Whitney (on the present day site of Home Depot). From 1919 to 1947, he was president of the Underwood Typewriter Company. He died at age 63, six weeks after the vote and the Board decided to name the new school after him. As early as December 1956, the newspaper reported that Hall would go on double sessions for the first three months of school in 1957 because it was not clear that the building would be done in time. However, by March, Republican candidates for the Board of Education pushed the School Building Committee to have the building open for September 1. Builders could have the classroom building ready, but the gym and auditorium would not come on line until about three months later. In February 1957, the Superintendent named Hall Principal, Henry Weyland to be Principal at the new high school. Town officials worried about how the new school would be perceived, and sending Weyland to Conard made sense. He served as principal until 1974. Henry Rives, vice-principal at Hall was promoted to be Hall’s principal. Superintendent Edmund Thorne announced the school boundary lines at the same time. Those who attended King Philip and Talcott Junior High would attend Conard. All Plant Junior High students went to Hall, in the center of town and the students at Sedgwick were split. Hall became a walking school, with about 60 percent of the number of students at Conard. Its population differed from today in that it was a north and south end school until the new Hall building opened in 1970. When school opened on September 4, 1957, the school day began at 8:30 at the high and junior high schools. Students had a seven period day. About 1,150 students entered Conard on the first day. Over 11,000 attended the West Hartford Public Schools, in 15 different schools, more students than in 2006. Dress in the first years of the school was strictly defined. There were no dungarees, no t-shirts, and no sneakers or cowboy boots. Girls had to wear skirts. Leather jackets were banned because of their connection to motorcycle gangs. The course selection book offered different choices in 1957. Choices for the three years were limited by requirements and fewer elective classes. One requirement since 1952, was Driver Education The town had one full time teacher in each high school to teach this class. This practice lasted into the late 1970s. Academic departments have remained the same, though the content in each has changed. As early as 1963, the NEASC report on Conard encouraged history teachers to teach less about military battles. The first Advanced Placement classes made their way into the curriculum in the mid-1960s. Home economics classes were strictly for girls. One course, taught girls the “basics of being a housewife.” Industrial Arts courses, including auto mechanics, drafting, and woodworking were designed strictly for boys. Changes in these programs came in the mid 1970s with federal pressure from Title IX. The tradition of a school musical began in that school year. Music teacher William Lauer directed the first musical “Oklahoma.” Lauer began the tradition of having two casts, one for each night to give more students a chance to have lead roles. This tradition ended in the early 2000s. When the school opened in 1957, boys could choose from eight sports teams. There were no interscholastic sports for girls. Girls joined the leaders club and played “competitively” on one day in the Fall. In 1970 girls competed in interscholastic Track and Field and not until 1986 did they reach parity with the boys with the number of sports teams. On November 9, 1957, Conard played Hall in football for the first time and the contest was at Conard’s just completed stadium. Both teams came in with winning records, and each had a chance to win the CCIL championship. With Coach Bob McKee at the helm, his Chieftains defeated the Frank Robinson’s Hall Warriors 7-6. Today, in 2006, the grandson of Conard’s captain in that first game plays on the Conard team. The Chieftains were boosted by the first appearance of the Pep Band, led by William Lauer, and the Pep Club with over 300 students dressed in scarlet and gray. More than 2,500 fans overflowed the stands to watch the first of many contests between these two rivals, many of which determined championships. On November 18, 2006, Conard and Hall will play their 50th football game. It looks like, just as in 1957, that a title might be at stake. The rivalry is just as fresh today as it was 50 years ago, but now it includes 26 teams with both girls and boys. In June 2007, Conard will have its 50th graduation. There are some stirrings of a commemoration for these events. Those who graduated in the first class in 1958 are now in their mid-60s and do indeed have grandchildren old enough to be students at the high school. The traditions of learning and of school spirit are still alive and well. "],

The main goal of this plan was to allow West Hartford to maintain its residential character, while allowing for industrial and commercial growth in specific areas of the city, and to move traffic. What spawned this development plan? Why did the town feel compelled to draw up such a comprehensive plan at that particular time? In the 1950s, West Hartford’s population grew from 44,402 to 62,382. Our population in 2003 is estimated at 63,000. And at the same time developers bought up farmland for housing developments and retail developers built strip malls in four different locations in town. Between 1949 and 1959, the town built 11 new schools. Town residents worried that building was out of control and that just anything could be put up if one had the money, or if the population kept growing The 1962 plan projected a peak population of 85,000 and residents were concerned about what this meant for their quality of life in town. The town council spent meeting after meeting consumed by these development controversies as open space disappeared. Commercial development caused tension between residents, the developers and the Town Council as the town weighed its tax base, its residential nature, and the desire of developers to make money and provide shopping facilities in town. When Lord &amp; Taylor moved to the southwest quadrant of Bishops Corner in 1955, most of West Hartford’s 62,000 residents shopped in downtown Hartford. This Lord &amp; Taylor was the chain’s first ever suburban store. A survey completed by developers in 1956 found that West Hartford residents spent only 35% of their consumer dollars in West Hartford. This was the fourth suburban Lord &amp; Taylor, and the first outside of New York. Built in 1954, the store had a restaurant called the Bird Cage, like all the other stores.

In 1956, developer Five City Plaza, Inc. believed that there was a retail market in West Hartford and proposed a $7 million shopping center at Corbin’s Corner. The town held a series of five public hearings, which attracted over 1,000 people. The developers, represented by attorney Frederick U. Conard, Jr., tried to convince Democratic Mayor Harold Keith and the Town Council that this development would be good for the town. Issues covered at the hearing included traffic, the residential nature of the town, value of residential property nearby, and the ability of the nearby brook to absorb run-off by the massive parking area. The plans called for 25 to 30 stores with Sears Roebuck as the anchor store. This Sears was planned to be the largest such store in New England. The Town Planning and Zoning Commission approved the plan for three separate buildings, cutting the size of the building farthest to the south, and not allowing Sears to have an automotive center. The Town Council voted 5-2 to approve the development on February 13, 1957 and immediately they were criticized for their vote. Of the two who voted the plan down, Republican Minority Leader Richard Smith argued that the elected officials were not doing enough to put the development in context. He argued that the development should not only be looked at from the standpoint of how it affected the geographical area, but also for its long term impact. He believed the plan needed to be part of a “comprehensive plan for the general area involved, which includes the large tract of land of the Minnie Corbin Kohn estate lying just to the west of the property here involved.” This area became Westfarms Mall 15 years later. Residents of the southwest section of town appealed the Town Council’s approval to the Court of Common Pleas on the basis that the shopping center was too large for the area, would create traffic problems, and depreciate the value of their homes. The association also questioned whether this shopping center could be successful. Everett Clark, president of the Southwest Association claimed, “If it fails, the town will be left with a white elephant.” The Common Court of Pleas rejected the appeal seven months later in September 1957. The judge believed he did not have jurisdiction and that this zoning question was a local matter. The property owners vowed to take the case to the state Supreme Court. The Supreme Court heard the case in June 1958, and in August the court voted unanimously to uphold the decision of West Hartford’s Town Council, then 16 months after council approval. At the same time, the Town Council faced a proposal to build a shopping center on the southeast quadrant of Bishops Corner and the Council sent it back to the Zoning Commission for a definite recommendation. In July 1958, the Common Pleas Court also ordered the Town Council to accept the petition for a $4 million shopping center on the northwest corner of South Main Street and New Britain Avenue. The Town Council did not approve this petition, filed in April 1956. In February 1959, two years after the Town Council approved the plan, Corbin’s Corner residents voted to fight proposed changes in plans for the shopping center. They opposed a proposed fire and battery service building and plans to build a bowling alley in the basement of one of the buildings. In the same month developers proposed another shopping center on the corner of Farmington Avenue and Boulevard with an A&amp;P supermarket as the anchor store. By June 10, 1959 the Town Council gave unanimous final approval to the Corbin’s Corner Plan requiring the developers to build a 6 ½ foot fence along the south side of the property, installing 28 foot high light poles, and prohibiting outside display of merchandise. Sears got approval for the automotive center, but the plan for a bowling alley was denied. In July 1959, residents appealed the June action of the Town Council which changed the zone of some of the land included in Corbin’s Corners. They lost this appeal. One of the last things the Democratically controlled Town Council did was to vote down the Farmington Avenue - Boulevard shopping center, claiming that it would decrease the value of homes in the area, despite the fact that the town planner had recommended its approval. These contentious debates about town development allowed residents a say in the type of town they lived in, and many would argue, produced a better plan for development. In 2003, with a town with almost no open space, the town again is weighing its tax base, its residential nature, and the desires of developers to make money and provide shopping facilities in the center. In February 2003, Scott Slifka proposed a new task force to be responsible for economic development in town. While West Hartford’s tax base has been somewhat stagnant for the past 20 years, there are some big new development possibilities both in Elmwood and in the center. The council believes that taking a proactive stance on development can ease some of the tensions of 45 years ago as developer’s desires to build and increase the tax base were balanced with retaining the special character of our town. What Are Your Boundaries? Adapted from a talk given at Emanuel Synagogue, “Why Do You Live Where You Live?” November 2, 2017. If you walk or bike into Beachland Park from Manchester Circle, as so many school children did in the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s to get to the Elmwood School and Talcott Junior High, right to the south of the path is a stone with a plaque. The plaque, mounted on a stone says, THE FELDMAN WALKWAY THIS WALKWAY IS NAMED BY THE TOWN COUNCIL IN HONOR OF RABBI ABRAHAM J. FELDMAN, D.D. DISTINGUISHED CLERGYMAN AND CITIZEN OF WEST HARTFORD NOVEMBER 10, 1958 DEDICATED JUNE 1960 Marker dedicated to Rabbi Abraham Feldman, located at the Manchester Circle entrance to Beachland Park Why was Rabbi Feldman (1893-1977) commemorated at this particular spot in 1960? Who paid for this? And why would it be in the south end of town, which was not known to be a place where many Jewish people lived? Historians who study settlement patterns for Jewish people and African Americans in cities and suburbs look at many factors that contribute to where they live in communities. Redlining by banks, real estate agent steering, federal housing funding, vicinity to houses of worship, and education are among the many factors that both narrow and broaden choices for homeowners. Through interviews with Jewish people who moved to West Hartford in the 1950s or 60s, we learn that it was “understood” by many that they could not live in certain neighborhoods. Informal exclusionary boundaries included Sunny Reach Drive, Westwood Road and Colony Road near the Hartford Golf Club, the West Hill District, on Hunter Drive on the mountain, Sunset Farms and Wood Pond. Though no written restrictions by race or religion have been found, often in these neighborhood associations, houses never went on the market, but were passed along by word of mouth to family members or those who were deemed to be “appropriate” to live within the bounds of their neighborhoods. And even if a Jewish family offered $30,000 in cash to buy a house along Farmington Avenue, their real estate agent might report back that the seller took the house off the market, rather than sell to them. So while bankers, federal mortgage programs, and real estate agents have been the targets of restrictions on who lived in neighborhoods, in West Hartford, it was also builders who controlled the market. As builders flocked to town to buy up farmland in the north end, the southwestern section of town and the center of Elmwood and take advantage of the push for suburban housing, some of these builders tightly controlled who bought their newly-built homes. Brothers Victor and Raymond Carnelli were two of those builders who developed houses in West Hartford. They built hundreds of houses in town between 1945 and 1970. Carnelli built on Longlane, Winterset Lane and Hartwell Road before the new Hall High was built in 1970. They also built on Cherryfield Drive and Foxridge Road near Conard High School, and Orchard Road on the mountain. The Carnelli Construction Company named their development near Eisenhower Park “Whitewood Farms.” A September 1960 Hartford Courant display ad for a Carnelli home on Winterset Lane, near Eisenhower Park said “Short drive to Bishop’s Corner, Shopping Center, New St. Timothy’s Parish and School, New Norfeldt School, Wampanoag Country Club and a newly proposed park.” Carnelli was clearly marketing to a Roman Catholic audience. West Hartford had the reputation and the history of being controlled by Protestants, and though there are six Catholic Churches in town in 2018, in 1960 there were only three. At the same time, Beth El Temple and Tumblebrook were also close to this development, but Carnelli chose not to mention them. One person I spoke with recalled, “Jews could not buy a Carnelli home” and some in the Jewish community called this area around Eisenhower Park “Vatican Village.” In the early 1940s, Carnelli included a restrictive covenant in at least two developments, Foxridge Road and Sunrise Hill which said that: No persons of any race except the white race shall use or occupy any building on any lot except that this covenant shall not prevent occupancy by domestic servants of a different race employed by an owner or tenant. In many ways, Carnelli was following the spirit of the times. William Levitt, famous for his developments which became Levittowns on Long Island, in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and three towns in Maryland – all had restrictive covenants. Blacks sued Levitt to be allowed to live in these towns. And though Levitt was Jewish, even he, at first, would not sell to Jews. At the same time that Carnelli was building, so was Irving R. Stich. In 1954, Stich, a Jewish developer, who owned the company Ogden Homes, sold one of his homes on Miles Standish Drive, right west of Conard High School, to Frederick Neusner and Millicent Silverstone Neusner. Frederick Neusner’s father, a Russian immigrant, appeared in the 1940 census as a salesman for the Jewish Ledger, living on Asylum Avenue with his wife and three children. His son Frederick was 15 in 1940. Fourteen years later, he and his wife bought the house on Miles Standish. Stich, like Carnelli, built hundreds of houses in West Hartford and in the Greater Hartford area. While Carnelli was discriminating against blacks and Jews on Foxridge Road and Sunrise Hill, just two streets south, Stich built houses on John Smith and Miles Standish Drive that Jews bought, and this in the south end of town. Stich, the developer, was also president of the Webster Construction Company which developed 60 one-family “low-cost” homes on Manchester Circle. He was the man who donated the building lot to make the right-of-way through Beachland Park and put up the commemorative stone to Rabbi Abraham Feldman. On November 22, 1958, the West Hartford Town Council approved a proposal to name the walkway between Beachland Park and Manchester Circle for Rabbi Feldman, a Russian immigrant and rabbi of Beth Israel Synagogue on Farmington Avenue. Mayor Harold F. Keith, the first Democratic Mayor of West Hartford and first Catholic mayor, thanked Irving Stich, who gave land for the right of way into the northwest corner of the park. Stich requested that the path be named for Rabbi Feldman and Stich offered to defray any expenses connected with the dedication, according to the Hartford Courant article. Did Stich want to say: Jewish people can live in the south end, too? Or if Jewish people are being discriminated against, was he saying: I’m staking a claim here with this plaque for future generations to see? Feldman’s plaque makes us think about invisible boundaries that exist all over our town. Are there places you don’t feel comfortable going? And how can we, like Stich, try to break down those barriers? Town Center: The 1960s and Today Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, October 2004 The homeowners of WH cannot permanently go on watching the residential character of our neighborhood and our town undermined and destroyed without doing something constructive about it. In the last decade zoning decisions have had the wholly regressive tendency of commercializing our town. The have outraged the common sense of the people who must bear the burden of decisions which devalue their homes, rob them of prized social and psychological values, and then burden them with assessments for road improvements, increased traffic and taxes for additional town services. – West Hartford Federation of Homeowner Associations Resolution, 1961 West Hartford residents have always cared about the character of their town. Whenever changes are proposed, residents and homeowners wonder if West Hartford will continue to be the town in which they chose to live. The Federation of Homeowners in 1961 reacted to the tremendous growth in retail in the town with the opening of Lord &amp; Taylor in Bishops Corner in the mid-1950s, and the plans for Corbins Corner in the early 1960s. The Town Council, Town Manager and Town Planner were all concerned about what these developments would do to the town center and they spent much time, money and political capital on trying to insure its continued success. At first glance, the Homeowner Association quote might have come from the Save Our Center group concerned about the present-day construction of Blue Back Square. How have their concerns changed as the town developed from a growing suburb in the 1950s and 1960s to a mature suburb with little population growth in the 21st century, and how have they stayed the same? In 1951, when the Town Council commissioned a comprehensive town plan from the private firm of Alfred Kaehrle, the town’s character truly was changing. The town’s population stood at 44,000, and had grown about 33% since 1940. Residential neighborhoods sprouted up on any undeveloped land. Downtown Hartford was still the main shopping area for the region, Lord &amp; Taylor had not yet opened in Bishop’s Corner, and Sears in Corbin’s Corner was not yet planned. Burnham’s grocery store on South Main Street across from the Town Hall anchored the Town Center. Since 1898, it had been the hub of shopping in the center. Angled parking at curbside brought customers right up to the stores, but people complained about traffic and feared losing the residential nature of this town. Residents were clear that West Hartford was a residential town, not a city like Hartford and that was a good reason to live here. Hartford’s population peaked in 1950 at about 170,000; out-migration grew tremendously in the 1960s and 1970s as highways connected suburbs to city and shopping moved to strip malls in the suburbs. The town had to provide services for its growing population. Between 1949 and 1959, 11 new schools were built in West Hartford. Even though the tax base continued to grow, the town had to scramble to keep up with the explosion in school age population and the increased traffic. In the 1950s, residents who moved here characterized the town as a suburb, not a city. The town government reaffirmed those beliefs. By 1959, the Town Planning and Zoning Commission had reworked Kaehrle’s 1951 town center proposal to encourage its commercial growth while maintaining the neighborhoods in the center. The plan included the extension of Walden Street from Farmington Avenue to Arapahoe Road, and the extension of Arapahoe from LaSalle Road to South Main with an eventual link up through Memorial Road to Trout Brook Drive (just completed in 2004). LaSalle Road would end at Ellsworth and not go through to Pelham Road to maintain the residential nature of the town outside the perimeter of traffic. The TPZ wanted to build a perimeter traffic plan because traffic was a problem at the main intersection of Farmington Avenue and Main Street and to contain development within the perimeter formed by Walden and Arapahoe on the south and west. According to Town Manager, Richard L. Brown, the plan would keep the residential areas safe and stable. By this time, Lord &amp; Taylor’s 100,000 square foot store in Bishop’s Corner and the planned Sears Roebuck with 130,000 square feet in Corbin’s Corner threatened businesses in the center. The town planners foresaw opening a “junior department store” in the center to support specialty shops. In 1959, the Town Center’s largest dry goods store had 15,000 square feet. The new plan included concern about parking with the proposal for a two-level parking lot. Plans also surfaced for a 100 room hotel with banquet facilities to be located on the southeast corner of Trout Brook and Farmington (where the Exxon station is today.) The new Hall High School on North Main did not open until 1970, but already in 1959, town planners knew that the new school would be built, just two years after the completion of Conard. Some wanted the Old Hall kept as an education center after the north end high school was built. One plan had this building transformed into a college; the high percentage of West Hartford’s high school graduates who planned college level studies, they thought, would produce an overflow of students who would not be able to enroll in a traditional college and this building could provide a place for residents to complete the first two years of college work on a tuition basis. By 1962, the Town Council came up with still another comprehensive plan for development. The plan was based on the population continuing to grow from 62,000 to 80,000 in 20 years. The population actually peaked in 1967 at about 73,000 and then declined until the 2000 census to about 61,000. The continued thrust of this plan was to establish the character of the town as a residential community. The plan said, “the prime planning objective is to preserve the town’s good residential character” and to keep high standards in planning any new developments. No more than 10% of the town would be for commercial or industrial use. In 1962, according to the plan, people “shop, work and recreate” outside of West Hartford. There was much talk about zoning for apartments as that was seen as the only means for residential growth. In 2004, 42 years later, residents again speak out about development in the town center. But unlike the 1960s, West Hartford no longer portrays itself as only a residential suburb. This new Blueback Square development is a mixed use development which integrates residential, office and retail space so that use of the area is spread out over the course of the day. Residents continue to be concerned about the character of the town. The concerns about traffic and residential neighborhoods continue. And with this development, instead of the Town Center reacting to development in the north and south ends of town, Westfarms Mall has weighed in with apprehensions about how the center’s growth will affect their retail sales. Residents today, just as 40 years ago, raise the concern that the town may become too urban and lose what they consider to be the “small town” residential feel. The town government continues to work as a partner with developers, in their efforts toward controlled development which balances the need for new tax revenues, with neighborhood concerns, and with the changing role the town of West Hartford plays as a regional destination for shopping and nightlife. As West Hartford residents have always done, they will continue to candidly question the motives of both government officials and commercial developers in the debate over how new developments define the town’s character. “Remember Me”: The Vietnam War Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, February 2005 “Remember Me.” These are the plaintive words of Joe Donahue, historian of the Connecticut Veteran Memorial soon to be built in the center of town on the site where the first church was built in the West Division. Donahue has spent two years researching the 202 West Hartford war casualties. Donahue’s passion for finding out about these casualties embodies the spirit behind the building of the war memorial in the center of town. A look at the 17 men who died in the Vietnam War gives a window on the sacrifices made by a country, a state, and a town when the federal government chooses to go to war. The average age of the men who died was 24. Two men who died were 35; of the 15 others, the average age was 22. Four graduated from Hall, two from Conard, two from Kingswood and one from Northwest Catholic. Five were college graduates from Georgetown, University of Pennsylvania, the Naval Academy, Trinity, and Norwich University and all 17 graduated from high school. All were listed as Christian. Geographically, only one man lived north of Asylum Avenue. One man lived on Hunter Drive, two in the Buena Vista area, and three in the area around Kennedy Park. Two lived near Fern Perk, three near Morley School, and one near Conard. Nine of the men died on the ground, one the result of an accidental homicide. Seven died in helicopter or plane crashes. The highest national and town casualties were in the year 1968, the year of the Tet Offensive. For the nation, 14,000 died, which was about 25% of total casualties. In West Hartford, 6 of our 17 were killed in that year. Below is a short paragraph on each man who died based on Donahue’s research. They are listed in the order in which they died. Brian John Cronin, 775 Farmington Avenue was a Navy bombardier navigator aboard a light bomber that crashed in an unknown area. His plane was downed in the South China Sea. He was West Hartford’s first casualty and died in December 1964 at age 24. He played tennis. He went to UCONN where his father was Dean of the UConn School of Social Work. He graduated from East Hartford High School, and then lived with his widowed mother before he enlisted. JFK was his hero and he joined the Navy because of it. Edmund Francis Eddy, of West Point Terrace was killed by small arms fire in March 1966. He was a Marine Corps Field Radio Operator. He was 22 when he died in Quang Ngai Province. Edward Gaffney Creed, of North Steele Road, was killed in June 1966 in Thua Thien Province. He was a crew member on a medical evacuation mission when his helicopter caught fire from hostile gunfire and crashed. He was 21 when he died. He served for three 1/2 years. David Hight, of Meadow Farms Road, was in the Army, and died at age 24 somewhere in Vietnam in June 1966. He died from wounds suffered from a grenade. He signed up for two years of service but died after serving for nine months. His parents moved to West Hartford the year Hight graduated from high school in New York state. He graduated from Norwich University. John Welch III, age 24 from 28 North Quaker Lane and a graduate of St. Thomas Parochial School, Hall High School, and Georgetown University (1965) died of wounds suffered on the ground at Quang Ngai in February 1967. He entered Marine Corps Officers’ Candidate School in January 1966 and graduated with honors. He arrived in Vietnam in October 1966 and served for five months. Welch had a brother at the U.S. Naval Academy at the time and one other brother and two sisters. William Markarian lived on Bretton Road and died from an explosive device at age 19 at Thua Thien. He left for Vietnam in May 1967 and died nine months later. He had been a gardener with Baker’s Nursery in Tariffville before he entered the military. Crosley Fitton, Jr. died in February 1968 at age 35. He was an Air Force pilot flying an F105 Thunderchief on a combat mission as part of the Tet Offensive, flying over the outskirts of Hanoi when his plane was hit by a surface to air missile. He and his co-pilot bailed out and parachuted safely to the ground. It was unclear what happened next as the Air Force listed them as “Missing in Action.” In 1975, Fitton’s remains were handed over to a U.S. congressional delegation to Hanoi. His wife, who had remarried by 1975, and his parents were skeptical that the remains were really his. At age 17, Fitton and four other West Hartford boys went to Detroit to compete in a national model plane contests sponsored by Plymouth. His interest in planes continued. He was married and lived on Oakwood Avenue John P. Holden II, who lived on Farmington Avenue, died at age 24 in Quang Tri Province. He served in the Marines and was killed in a mid-air collision of helicopters that had picked up four wounded Marines near Khe Sanh in February 1967. He was married. Army Corporal Radioman Adam Knecht, age 20 from Oakwood Avenue was killed at Binh Duong in May 1968 of multiple fragmentation wounds. Adam lived in West Hartford until he was 11. In one of his last letters, Knecht had questioned “the purpose of wasting young American lives” in the Vietnam conflict. He was drafted. Raymond Coyle Daley lived on East Normandy Drive and died in Quang Nam province in July 1968 when his helicopter was downed by enemy fire. He served as a First Lieutenant in the Marine Corps. He won the Air Medal, Purple Heart, Vietnam Service and Campaign Medal and National Defense Medal. He was 24 when he died. He graduated from Hall High School and attended Providence College and the Naval Academy. Robert Lyon Norton of Keeney Avenue and a graduate of Hall High school died at age 35 in Quang Nam Province in December 1968 as the result of a plane crash under hostile fire. He served for 14 years in the Marine Corps. Norton received the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal and the Purple Heart. He lived most of his life in West Hartford. He was an Eagle Scout and graduate of the Hall High class of 1951. He attended UCONN, but did not graduate, entering the Naval Air Cadet Program during the Korean War. Mark Hannay Dixon, of Uplands Drive died at age 23 in Quang Nam province. He earned a Purple Heart, Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Army Commendation for his service. He was killed trying to rescue a wounded comrade in Quang Nam. His Silver Star citation said that he “courageously crawled, under intense enemy fire, to the fallen soldier and began to administer first aid.” As he tried to carry the man to safety, he was hit by enemy fire. His tour of duty began in late March 1969 and he died one month later. He graduated from University of Pennsylvania. He was going to enter University of Michigan Law School in 1970. His father was a lawyer. Classmates at Kingswood established a scholarship for him and collected $6,500. Thomas Hill, of Florence Street died at age 21 in Binh Duong province by a mortar missile. He served as a Warrant Officer in the US Army and was killed in June 1969. He was a member of the first graduating class at St. Brigid School, attended Northwest Catholic, Cheshire Academy and Wichita State University in Kansas. He entered the Army in October 1968 and became a helicopter pilot. Hill’s father was a Fire Captain in town and his mother a secretary to U.S. Senator Abraham Ribicoff. Marine Lance Corporal Douglas Whiting Young, age 21 was killed on December 20, 1969 in Quang Nam Province as a result of an accidental homicide. He lived on Longview Road and graduated from Kingswood School in 1966 and attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for two years. He was a member of the First Church of Christ Congregational. Loring McKenzie Bailey, Jr., of Saint Augustine Street, was age 24 when he was killed in March 1970 at Quang Ngai Province on the ground. He was with the U.S. Army infantry. He was married. He served for only 5 ½ months before he died. He graduated from Trinity College in 1967. His wife was from West Hartford, though he grew up in Stonington. Norman Westwood, from Terrace Road and a 1962 graduate of Conard High School, was killed at age 25 in May 1970. Westwood graduated from St. Anselm’s College. After college he joined the Navy. Westwood flew more than 100 missions and was awarded the Air Medal. He served for four years in the Navy in the reserves and as a pilot. He died when his F-4 Phantom fighter failed in its takeoff from the USS Coral Sea for a bombing mission over North Vietnam. His plane sank in the South China Sea. Westwood was the son of the West Hartford Deputy Fire Chief. Westwood hoped to return to the U.S. in June and marry his fiancé from California. Gary Lewis, from South Street, graduated from Conard in 1969 and was 20 when he was killed by a booby trap in Quang Nam on June 30, 1971. Lewis enlisted in October 1969. His parents said his tour of duty was up in September and he was planning to come home to go to college. Jeffrey Weed died in an airplane crash on his way to Vietnam on April 6, 1972. He was a Captain in the US Marine Corps. He grew up in West Hartford, and earned his Eagle Scout. He graduated from Mount Hermon School in Northfield, MA and then from Lehigh University in Pennsylvania. He had a low lottery number and chose to enlist. Because he was not in combat when his plane went down in the South China Sea, his name cannot appear on the Vietnam War Memorial. However, his name is on West Hartford’s wall. The Veterans on the War Memorial Committee want the information Donahue gathered to be used in West Hartford’s history classrooms. Gathering the raw material is the first step toward helping teachers teach about war from a local perspective. As historians, teachers know that to accurately teach about war, they need to show many viewpoints: of those who fought, those who protested and those whose lives changed on the home front. Learning about those who died in service to the country is one these perspectives. Democrats vs. Republicans: 1958-1972 Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, October 2001 In 1961, it was socially improper, economically stupid and politically unwise to be a Democrat in West Hartford. But in 1972, it is an idea that has arrived. This statement, made by Harry Kleinman, then Democratic Town Chairman, attorney, and past judge of the West Hartford Police Court, makes me wonder what changed in the town, at the state level, and at the federal level that turned West Hartford from a Republican to a Democratic town over these years. Kleinman’s statement was a bit of hyperbole because, 17 years earlier, in 1955, Democrats gained control of the Town Council for the first time in the town’s 101 year history. At that time, the town was split into seven districts and Town Councilors were elected by district. Two years later, in 1957, Republicans outnumbered Democrats 14,000 to 6,000 but the Democrats maintained their 4-3 council majority by a mere four votes in the sixth district (Morley School and Quaker Hose Firehouse areas). Most of the Republicans lived in the first (largely north of Farmington and Asylum Avenues) and second districts (Town Hall, Sedgwick and Webster Hill School areas.) These two districts had a much larger populations than the other five, but the districts established in the 1920s were not readjusted as the population grew. In an article written for the West Hartford News in 1972, Nan Glass, former Democratic Mayor of West Hartford chronicled the history of the Democratic Party. She wrote that the original Democrats in West Hartford, prior to World War II, were largely Irish Catholics from the south end of town. The chairmanship of the party held by Edward P. Quinn was passed to his sister Katherine in 1942 when he resigned to become Registrar of Voters. She was chairman for 10 years and then Richard T. Scully took over when Quinn became involved in the state and national Democratic Party structure. Following World War II, in the 1950s and 1960s, Irish from the south end dominated the party: Brian O’Meara, Robert Shea, Helen Murray, Dorothy Muldoon, Thomas O’Neill Jr. and Edward B. Connors all played major roles in Democratic politics and town government. In the 1960s, a steady stream of Jewish voters moved from the North End of Hartford to northern West Hartford. They brought with them their Democratic Party affiliation. They were joined by a growing number of residents of Italian background. A fourth faction included the “Yankee” liberals –- like Catherine C. Reynolds and State Senator Jay Jackson, the first Democrat from West Hartford to be elected to the State Senate in 1966. In the early 1970s, with the 26th Amendment and the anti-Vietnam War movement, the Democratic Party made a big effort to register 18 to 21 year olds as Democrats. These constituencies led the Democrats to pull ahead of the Republicans in registration by 1971, 15,000 to 14,200 with 13,000 unaffiliated voters. However, that did not mean that the Democrats dominated politics, even in the 1970s. Just as demographics changed over the 40-year period, so did the nature of the electorate. In 1958, the liberal Abe Ribicoff was the first Democratic Governor ever to win West Hartford. But West Hartford voters remained conservative on local issues. A referendum to allow the sale of liquor in restaurants on Sunday was defeated for the second time 9,195 to 5,457 with only one precinct, King Philip School, voting in favor. But Republicans did not take these local and state wins lightly. In 1958, a new charter, supported by the Republicans, who outnumbered Democrats 3 to 1, allowed Town Councilors to be elected at large, rather than by district. In April 1959, under the new charter, the Republicans took control back from the Democrats winning six seats and the Democrats winning three. The April 1961 election found the Republicans in control once more, though the gap in registration narrowed slightly. National politics in 1964 displayed the independence of the voters. Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson swept the district with 65% voting for him. Local Republican leaders were visibly upset with Barry Goldwater’s showing. This was the first time a Democratic presidential candidate won in West Hartford. Democrat Thomas Dodd defeated the Republican ex-Governor John Lodge for Senate. The jubilant party at Democratic headquarters on New Britain Avenue was filled with young Democrats who had started a young adult political organization, United Democrats for West Hartford, in August of 1964. This group enrolled many new voters and claimed their share in the margin of victory. In 1967, the Republicans maintained a majority in registration, 14,200 to 11,400. There were 13,300 unaffiliated voters, who tended to lean to the Republicans. Popular Republican Mayor Richard Sheehan did not run for re-election. The Democrats won the election and took control of the Town Council 6-3. Architect John M. Huntington became Mayor even though he was the third highest vote getter. It was thought that he was the butt of negative campaigning when Republicans accused him of supporting “reverse busing” to integrate the schools, the “Project Concern” initiative, even though he did not. The 1968 Democratic primary voters could choose between Eugene McCarthy, Robert Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey and this led to a split in the local Democratic Party, but ultimately led to a majority of Democratic registered voters. The national party called for a modernization of party machinery and changes that would “democratize” the party. The party establishment felt the purpose of the town committee was to get Democrats elected while the newcomers in the form of the Caucus of Connecticut Democrats were more interested in the party taking positions on social issues. This particular faction of the party supported Eugene McCarthy for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Oliver and Mims Butterworth spearheaded this group. The CCD managed to oust Katherine Quinn, the second most powerful Democratic Party leader in Connecticut, from the Democratic State Central Committee, a position she had held for 40 years. Mims Butterworth, a McCarthy supporter, took her place on the state committee from the 5th District. However, the Democrats controlled the town for only two years. In 1969, Republicans won the Town Council, 6-3 and chose Ellsworth Grant as Mayor. The Democratic slate in the 1971 election was entirely new, except for incumbent Brian O’Meara, and did better than any other slate in history. Catherine Reynolds, in her first election, was the top vote- getter. The Democratic newcomers actually beat a Republican incumbent. The Democrats gained one seat in the Council (5-4) and gained control of the Board of Education (4-3). The Republican Party chairman, Alfred ”Tim” Covello credited the Democratic presence to a general unhappiness with government at all levels, especially on the federal level. By 1971, many voters opposed Nixon’s policies in Vietnam and that may have been felt in the election. But, the Republicans came back strong in the 1972 federal election with President Nixon defeating McGovern by 23,000 to 18,000. At the same time, Bill Cotter (D) defeated Republican Rittenband for Congress and Republican Nicholas Lenge defeated Democratic incumbent Jay Jackson for the State Senate seat. The Democrats lost municipal elections in 1975 and 1977, and with the defeat of Jackson in 1976, Harry Kleinman felt it was time to give up the reins of the Democratic Party. He resigned after holding the position for 17 years. Kleinman helped build the party through voter registration, but it was up to the next generation to consistently win elections. West Hartford’s thoughtful electorate could not easily be bound to party, but by the 1970s it was no longer an embarrassment or liability to be a Democrat. West Hartford in 1959 Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, October 2009 Fifty years ago, the West Hartford News published the Town Report written by Town Manager Donald Blatt who wanted to educate citizens on how the town government used their tax dollars. The Town’s population in 1959 was 60,000, just a few thousand less than the population in 2009. This report provides an interesting comparison of a town that was still growing in the 1950’s, with a mature West Hartford in 2009. The Town Report celebrated “Highlights of the Year Gone By.” In 1958 the town celebrated Noah Webster’s bicentennial celebration. In 2008 we celebrated his 250th birthday. A new town charter went into effect that allowed for the election of the school board, at large election of nine Town Council members, and guaranteed minority party representation. These revisions remain today. The town dedicated the Rutherford Building on Raymond Road and Memorial Drive, the remodeled north section of the Whitman School, as an Annex to the Town Hall. The building on that site today, built as part of the Blue Back Square development, is also called the Rutherford Building. The Town Hall with a gold dome on Main Street, built in 1936, now houses Flemings Steak House. Bridlepath School in the western part of town was completed in 1959. When the population of West Hartford peaked in 1970 at 70,000 and then dropped back to 60,000, many schools in town were closed. Bridlepath closed as a public school in the 1970s. In 1959, the town trumpeted its “continued program of sidewalk and sewer installation and street paving and reconstruction.” In 1959 though it was still legal to have a well and private septic system, the town was moving toward public water and sewers. The public works budget in the growing community made up almost 12% of the total budget. In 2009, with a developed infrastructure, public works make up only 1.6% of the budget. While today, school officials worry about the H1/N1 virus, in 1959, “special clinics were held monthly during the year for West Hartford school children who were unable to receive polio injections from their private physicians. 1,087 were given during the year.” The Town Report charted the prevalence of chickenpox, measles, mumps and German measles from 1948 to 1958. A measles vaccine became available in 1963, mumps in 1967, German measles or rubella in 1969, and chicken pox in 1995. With the Health Department’s 1959 budget of $2,023, sanitation staff chronicled diseases and increased food and milk inspections. As the 1959-60 school year got under way, the educational initiatives marked some changes in the town’s philosophy. One photograph is captioned “Schools respond to growing emphasis on Science,” responding to the national push that followed the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957. Funds from the National Defense Education Act (September 1958) encouraged the study of science, mathematics and foreign languages by funding professional development for teachers and building the infrastructure. Superintendent Thorne managed a $5 million budget to educate 11,563 pupils at about $430 per pupil. Even in the 1950s, West Hartford prided itself on having an excellent school system and not spending the most per pupil. The school budget made up about 43% of the town budget. In 2009-10 Superintendent Sklarz’s education budget stood at about $123,000,000 with 10,000 school children for a cost of over $12,000 per student. This accounted for 61% of the budget. According to a purchasing power translator, this is about four times the per pupil cost of 50 years ago. One major contributor to the increased costs of schools was the federal government’s mandate to educate all students that began with the Americans With Disabilities Act (1973) and then the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975. These Acts have increased the cost of education considerably. In 2009, the Special Education budget made up close to 20 percent of the entire school budget. In 1959, the system added honors courses in each subject area to strengthen the curriculum. Superintendent Thorne instituted an accelerated track in math allowing 8th graders to take high school level algebra. High School graduation requirements rose from 16 to 18 (in a three year high school) and the number of periods in the high school day increased from six to seven. Thorne encouraged a move to homogeneous groups in the elementary schools and formulated a program for “gifted” children. For the 2009 to 2010 school year, the West Hartford Public School initiatives are based around the 2002 federal No Child Left Behind Act, which required testing of all students, with follow up for those who have not achieved. Students continue to have an accelerated track in Math, but now requirements for graduation include 21 ¾ credits (in a four year high school) and they attend an eight period day. State legislatures in 2009 showed some interest in raising the number of credits needed to graduate from a Connecticut high school, but the economic downturn ended this initiative. Enrollment increased 119% from 1943 to 1959. The town built nine elementary schools over this time period, giving the town 21 school buildings. In 2009 there were 16 public schools and the student population had stabilized. Hall High School, built in 1924, had served as the only high school in town until Conard opened in 1957. Because of the age of Hall and its being landlocked in the center of town, in 1959, there was already talk of building another high school. However, according to the Town Report, “In light of the plans of the Archdiocese of Hartford to construct a high school in the near vicinity of the proposed North End High School, the target date for the latter has been postponed from 1961 to 1966-7.” Town officials felt that the opening of Northwest Catholic (1961) would take some enrollment pressure off the public schools. In 1959 there were 2 parochial schools in town and 11 private schools. The new Hall High School finally opened in 1970. The picture on the cover of the 1959 report depicts an adult male showing an open book to an eager boy, about eight years old, who looks up at the adult. They stand in front of the Noah Webster Library. This image of the importance of books, of knowledge, of the passing of information from one generation to another remains at the core of the town government’s ideals fifty years later. Conard’s Jimmy Johnson Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, February 2014 When Jimmy Johnson was elected captain of Conard’s 1959-60 basketball team, he became the first African American to hold that coveted position. He lived in a town that, just 10 years earlier, had restrictive covenants limiting the sale of homes to anyone Black. And only 39 black families (265 people or .3%) moved to town between 1959 and 1973. His experiences trumped the discrimination felt by others as he played the role that W.E.B. DuBois touted of one of the Talented Tenth. DuBois believed that the top ten percent of Blacks could be successful and help lead the way toward full community integration. Johnson moved to West Hartford on November 11, 1954, when it was one of the wealthiest towns in the United States. He, his parents, and his two sisters lived in the Duffy district. His father owned rental properties in Hartford. Johnson entered the 6th grade at Duffy School and at 5’6” entered 7th grade at Sedgwick Junior High. At Sedgwick he played soccer, basketball, baseball and handball. At that time, the four junior high schools had competitive sports teams and by 9th grade, Johnson starred on his 9th grade basketball team. His family clearly was financially successful. When not in school, Johnson spent time fishing in the MDC reservoir off Farmington Avenue. He went horseback riding in the reservoir as well, with his friend Bill Butler from Sunset Farms. Jimmy owned a horse for a year, until his father realized the high cost of stable charges and feed. Once in high school, Jimmy could be seen driving his late model Ford convertible around town. In the summer he played on the outdoor basketball courts at Duffy and at Morley. As a tenth grader, he played junior varsity but did not see much playing time. In the summer before his junior year, Johnson played 2 ½ hours a day, 5 days a week in his determination to play varsity his junior year. He claims he missed his sister Sandra’s Conard graduation because he was playing ball; Sandra was the first African American to graduate from Conard in 1959. In the late 1950s, summer games at Morley School on Fern Street brought great players and crowds. On these public courts, Johnson bragged that he would dunk so ferociously that “sparks flew off the chain-link net.” Johnson played with the likes of High School All American Johnny Egan (Weaver, Providence College and the NBA) and Ray Moore. When Egan played, cars were parked on both sides of the street for a ¼ of a mile. As a junior, Johnson made the varsity, being “welcomed… with open arms and kind words,” by star Ed Driscoll. Johnson was the inside player and Driscoll shot from outside. Johnson blocked at least three shots per game. In his junior year, Johnson was selected to the all-league team along with Driscoll. According to the Hartford Courant in 1959, “Heading the list of letterwinners is stylish Jimmy Johnson, the popular captain-elect of the Chieftains. He was my most improved player from a year ago,” said Coach Larry Stewart. “After four games with the Jayvees, he was moved up to the varsity where he finished second to Driscoll in both scoring and rebounding. He should have a fine year this time around.” In his senior year, Johnson (6’2’) was joined by Senior Ed Driscoll, 6’3”, sophomore Billy Dunn, 6’5”, Senior Dick Gitlin, 6’4”, and Senior Al Grotheer (6’4). That year, the team made the state tournament with a record of 10 and 6. On Friday nights, everyone from 13 to 20 years old, could be found in the Conard gym watching the team. Coach Stewart guided Johnson’s team to a 10-6 record in the ’59-’60 season. Driscoll and Johnson together scored about half of Conard’s points. On January 9, 1959, Hall’s boys’ basketball team beat Conard 49-43 before 1,400 fans at Conard’s gym. Conard’s Junior Jimmy Johnson and his teammates lost to their crosstown rival at a game that Hall was slated to win. Administrators had to turn spectators away because the gym was full. On their second meeting, five weeks later, Hall trounced Conard 65-48. Johnson scored 11 points. The game was played before a “capacity crowd at the Conard gym. Many fans were turned away before the varsity attraction even began due to lack of seats.” Conard won 7 of its last 10 games to nail down the 14th seed in the CIAC basketball tournament. Conard finished fourth in the nine team CCI League. In the tournament, they played Coach Howe Dickenman’s Norwich Acads. They played their first tournament game against Norwich in Storrs and lost in the final quarter with a come from behind win by the Acads, 53-38 with Johnson scoring 7, Billy Dunn with 10 and Driscoll with 13. In August, 1961, at the end of his junior year, Billy Dunn, 17, a class behind Johnson was killed in a car crash in Northampton, Massachusetts. Johnson, who had just graduated from high school, was devastated by Dunn’s death. Dunn’s parents who lived on Brenway Drive near Bugbee School, wrote a note to Jimmy and his parents which Johnson kept. Dunn’s mother Ruth wrote, “Bill loved Jimmie, and we all admire him greatly. We shall be greatly interested in his future, and hope he will come here sometimes as he used to… P.S. If we can ever help Jimmie with a job –- school problem –- or anything –- please come to us.” Johnson’s story reminded me of journalist Isabel Wilkerson’s 2011 New York Times essay, “A First Time for Everything,” in which she scoured obituaries in newspapers across the country and found over 300 obits that had one phrase in common, “the first African American to. . .” Wilkerson, argued that “Each position was in its own way both a happy triumph and a sad reminder of what it took to get there.” Does that tell the story of Jimmy Johnson, the first African American student at Conard to be named captain of a sports team? Even though in 1959, Johnson became captain of the boys basketball team, his legacy is not so well known. Johnson, now a successful trial lawyer in Michigan has kept in touch with many of his classmates and shared his pictures playing basketball with short snippets of his life in town. His experience here made a difference. And yet, it wasn’t until 16 years later, according to Conard Coach Eddie Litos, that another Black athlete appeared in a yearbook photo of a varsity team. Mark Walker started his career as a three year varsity player in 1973-4 having earned a letter when he was a sophomore. He became the captain in 1976. Between 1960-1974, according to Litos, no other African Americans appeared. According to Wilkerson, as she scanned the obituaries, she noted how mundane the “first” positions were, how modest the dreams had been. And yet, she argued, “they somehow bear witness to how far the country has come and how it got to where it is. They speak to how many individual decisions had to be made, how many chances taken, the anxiety and second-guessing at the precise instant that each of these people was hired for whatever humble or lofty position they sought.” For Johnson, in retrospect, his skill and determination seemed to trump the anxiety he may have felt integrating the team, and helped the white teammates accept him. At the same time, his role must have caused some tension in a town, where in 1959, when the Shelton family moved onto North Main Street, they found a note in their mailbox which said “get out of here, you black bastards, while you still can.” Johnson’s legacy, of a young man who starred, had friends, and made an effort to keep in touch with classmates, shows another side of the integration of the town. Johnson’s memories focus on his successes and his relationships which kindled his success. "],

Atwood Collins McCue, Sinatro and Reynolds", " The Fight for Justice School Prayer in 1963 Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, August 2013 Fifty years ago, when West Hartford students were heading back to school, the United States Supreme Court forced local Boards of Education to change their policy on school prayer. The policy at the time of the Supreme Court ruling stated that schools daily opening exercise “shall” include the Lord’s Prayer and a Bible reading. At the time, West Hartford’s Public Schools had almost equal numbers of Protestants, Jews and Roman Catholics. So this subject led to some controversy. The Board of Education needed to change its policy to be in tune with the Supreme Court rulings, but it did not happen immediately. In Engel v. Vitale (June 25, 1962) Justice Hugo Black wrote the decision (6-1) that a state written non-denominational prayer in New York abridged freedom of religion. Black argued that the prayer itself affirmed religion, making it unconstitutional. In late August 1962, the Chair of the West Hartford Board of Education, Attorney Willis G. Parsons Jr., ruled that the children would continue to say the Lord’s Prayer in West Hartford Public Schools. He argued that “We do not believe that this opinion can be used as a blueprint to cover all school activity involving some degree of religious expression.” Parson’s confident pronouncement came from the town’s lawyers, Nick Lenge and John Berman. They believed that their ruling also allowed for invocations at assemblies, Bible reading and grace before meals. In March 1963, the Supreme Court heard the Abington School District v. Schempp case in which Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark wrote the decision that prohibited state-sponsored prayer in schools. In the Abington case, (8-1) Clark prohibited all Bible readings and other government/school-sponsored religious activities in the school setting. Clark’s controversial opinion, issued on June 17, 1963, read: The place of religion in our society is an exalted one, achieved through a long tradition of reliance on the home, the church and the inviolable citadel of the individual heart and mind. We have come to recognize through bitter experience that it is not within the power of government to invade that citadel, whether its purpose or effect be to aid or oppose, to advance or retard. In the relationship between man and religion, the state is firmly committed to a position of neutrality. This ruling made it more clear that a daily prayer or Bible reading could not be done in school. The Rev. Gordon T. Scoville, minister of West Hartford’s Westminster Presbyterian Church welcomed the decision for upholding separation of church and state. He affirmed, in the Hartford Courant that, “I don’t believe the decision in any way asks us to give up God.” Others in the state did not agree with him. The State Commissioner of Education, William J. Sanders, sent a letter to superintendents explaining the significance of Abington to Connecticut public schools. He explained that boards of education could not open each school day with a required Bible reading or recitation of the Lord’s Prayer. He knew, though, that individual schools would determine religious practices in other areas of the school day. The Hartford Courant quoted superintendents from Barkhamsted, New Britain and Middletown saying that religious practices would continue as they were until someone complained. With the Abington ruling, West Hartford’s Board Chair Parsons knew policy had to change. Immediately after the ruling, he thought that West Hartford might replace the prayer with a moment of silence. A week after the ruling, Superintendent Edmund H. Thorne reported to the Board on how the ruling affected the schools. But still by mid-August, the Board had not ruled on the issue. Thorne asked for the Board to suspend the rule because school would soon begin. As of August 15, nothing in the School Code about prayers or reading the Bible reflected the new Supreme Court ruling. At the September 12 meeting, the Board of Education banned prayers or any other devotional exercises in the public schools during school hours. The vote was a divisive 4-3 with Chairman Parsons (R), Robert Thayer (D), Thomas Smith (D) and Charles Buck (R) voting for the ban. Dorothy McNulty (R), Robert Nichols (R) and William Mosehauser (R) did not vote for the ban. More than 80 people listened to the debate at King Philip School’s library. The vote proceeded in three steps. First McNulty made a motion to change the school code to read that the salute to the flag will be held during opening exercises and the teacher may have a “moment of silent meditation.” Then the Board adopted the same wording for assemblies. Democrat Thayer argued that these votes “placed the teacher in jeopardy,” by opening them up to “severe pressure” from parents and “noted that this has been done in other matters ‘many times’ by West Hartford parents.” Thayer argued that the Board was shirking its duties if it did not rule directly on the prayer issue. Thayer contended that the Supreme Court clearly defined a teacher’s religious role at school. He wanted a measure passed which said “no employee of the Town of West Hartford will conduct, or authorize students to conduct prayers on school premises.” Superintendent Thorne questioned Thayer, asking if this ruling would bar a teacher from saying a prayer at a Hi-Y or Boy Scout meeting after school but in the school building. Thayer said that the ruling would do that. Chairman Parsons reminded the Superintendent that the Supreme Court ruled that any type of devotional service in the schools was against the law during school hours. Thorne worried that the ruling would affect the Christmas programs in the schools and urged the board not to go any further than it had to. The Board voted down Thayer’s motion. This decision to separate church and state did not sit well with many people in town. The Hartford Courant reporter ended his article noting several teachers left the meeting dissatisfied that “grace” before and after meals was among the prayers banned. In 2002, in a post 9/11 context, the Connecticut General Assembly passed a law requiring that each town have a policy “to ensure that time is available each school day for students in the schools under its jurisdiction to recite the “Pledge of Allegiance.” The law cannot be construed as requiring any student to recite the Pledge, but the opportunity to say it has to be there. Does the “under God” portion of that pledge, added in 1954 as an anti-communist point, make this a type of prayer which injects religion into a government/school-sponsored activity? I wonder how Clark, Thorne, McNulty and Thayer would weigh in on this issue. The Butterworths Fought for Equal Representation Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, November 2010 In 1948, when Miriam “Mims” Butterworth and Oliver Butterworth moved from Kent to West Hartford, they lost equal representation in the General Assembly. At that time, Kent, with 1,400 people had two representatives in the state legislature, and West Hartford with more 40,000 people also had two representatives. The Butterworths had 28 times the representation in Kent as they had in West Hartford. In the next 14 years, they joined a class action lawsuit that changed representation in Connecticut under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. Every 10 years, the U.S. government takes a census to reapportion the U.S. House of Representatives. However, even though population shifted, there was no state law that forced the state to redistrict for the General Assembly. The House of Representatives was set up under the 1818 Constitution with two representatives per town and 12 senators were elected at large from the state. Twenty-one Senate districts were first established in 1829 and increased to 24 in 1881. The 1903 redistricting increased the senatorial districts to 35 and in 1941 a new district was added for Greenwich, making the 36 we have today. Connecticut’s last reapportionment was in 1904 and that one continued the dominance of the rural towns. The U.S. Supreme Court in Baker v. Carr (1962) decided that federal courts could intervene to decide how states would reapportion their representatives. Based on a suit brought by citizens of Tennessee, they argued that there should be a “one person, one vote” measure for redistricting. This case on representation, according to Justice Earl Warren, was “the most vital decision” during his career on the court, and the apportionment revolution which followed, he believed, was his most important achievement as Chief Justice. His ruling changed the way reapportionment was done from being decided politically by legislatures to allowing federal courts to decide the cases. The ruling in Baker v. Carr effectively ended the over-representation of rural areas (like Kent) in state legislatures and increased representation in suburbs like West Hartford. Central cities like Hartford had been under-represented, but by the 1960s were losing population to the suburbs and so their representation did not change much. Right after the Baker decision, 36 states began reapportionment battles. In Connecticut, talk turned quickly to reapportionment. The Republicans had a plan and the Democrats had a plan. Both parties knew the facts: 12 percent of the people elected the members of the House of Representatives in Connecticut. Both parties agreed that the 36-person state Senate did not fairly represent the population. However they disagreed on what should happen to the 294-member House. Democrats argued for a unicameral legislature based on population. The Republican plan would make just nine percent of people elect the General Assembly and would give them additional state senators. However, the legislature could not agree, so the decision came to the Courts. The Butterworth’s involvement in the case came through their connection to the League of Women Voters of Connecticut, which supported this suit. The League, a non-partisan political organization whose purpose it is to encourage active participation in government and fair elections, saw the apportionment issue as important enough to fund the lawsuit and to get plaintiffs to be part of the class action. Mims Butterworth was a member of the League. Ten people from six different towns joined this class action lawsuit filed in 1962. S. Rains Wallace from West Hartford’s 5th Senatorial District joined Oliver and Mims Butterworth. Two men from Manchester, one from East Hartford, two from Fairfield, one from Bridgeport and one from Hartford made up the group of 10 who believed they were not represented fairly according to the Fourteenth Amendment. Mims Butterworth became the only female plaintiff in the case, even though the League of Women Voters was a driving force behind it. Rains Wallace was married to a woman who, in 1956, was elected president of West Hartford’s League of Women Voters. He was a psychology lecturer at Yale and an active community member, heading up a drive for the symphony and as chairman for the Greater Hartford Community Chest. His wife later served as president of the Connecticut League of Women Voters and in the late 1960s was head of the Overseas Education Fund of the league. Oliver Butterworth was an author of children’s books including The Enormous Egg (1956) and The Trouble with Jenny’s Ear (1960) and a professor of English at Hartford College for Women. Mims Butterworth taught history at the Chaffee School and was active in the community. They claimed their voting rights “were being invidiously discriminated against” by the present apportionment of representatives, according to a Hartford Courant article from February 12, 1964. In a phone interview with Mims Butterworth, she remembered the case well. The plaintiffs were represented by Donald F. Keefe of Gumbart, Corbin, Tyler &amp; Cooper in New Haven. Ralph Shulansky of Shulansky &amp; Cohn in Hartford and the late West Hartford resident Ralph G. Elliot of Alcorn, Bakewell &amp; Smith of Hartford wrote the brief. They sued Gov. John Dempsey, Secretary of the State Ella Grasso, as well as the state Treasurer and Comptroller. Grasso’s daughter was a sophomore at Chaffee in 1963 and approached Butterworth. Grasso said “I hear you are suing my mother.” Butterworth said yes. Grasso continued, “well, I hope there will be something left for Christmas,” thinking that Butterworth was suing Grasso for all her worldly goods. Butterworth remembered the case being tried by the lawyers, but without the plaintiffs present. The lawyers argued at the U.S. District Court in New Haven and she and her husband wanted to sit in. They finally had a chance to go to the courtroom and found the proceedings fascinating. At lunchtime she remembered being taken out to lunch by the lawyers at a private club. Only men could go in the front door; she had to enter through the back door. But that was a fight for another day. The three-judge panel found in favor of Butterworth et al. in a 2-1 decision. They argued that their Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated. The court found that both houses of the General Assembly had to be redistricted and ordered the legislature to redraw its district boundaries. It also ordered the state to create a constitutional convention to rewrite the State Constitution to require redistricting every 10 years after the federal census. The court ordered that the legislature elected in 1963 serve until its successor took office in 1967 after the redistricting was completed, calling off the 1964 elections. The state appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which affirmed the decision of the three-judge panel. In 1965, the state called a constitutional convention, the first since 1818. According to Mims Butterworth, people rose to the occasion on both sides. She recalled that those who attended remembered it as being “the most satisfying political action they ever took.” In 2011, the state once again begin the process of redistricting to insure equal representation in our democracy. Women’s Rights Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, March 2011 In 1972, a married woman who wanted a library card could only get it in her husband’s name. The Hartford Courant posted jobs as “Help wanted – male” and “Help wanted – female.” And, even though the Civil Rights Act of 1964 stated that women could not be discriminated against in their work, women employed by the Town of West Hartford were stuck in secretarial and clerk jobs which gave them much lower pay than men. Bob Farr, as chair of the Human Rights Commission, faced these issues when the commission held a hearing on equal rights for women in 1972. The Commission sent invitations to 22 women’s organizations in the Hartford area including NOW and town employees. The Commission was originally established to address racial issues, but Farr argued in 1972, “There are few blacks in West Hartford,” and so saw few complaints brought to the commission. Farr hoped to find out if there was discrimination in making women administrators in the school system, town services, private industry, and in the provision of day care. The hearing led to the commission investigating employment practices by the town that the Commission believed could discriminate against women. At the public meeting, Christine Carpentier of 14 Richmond Road represented 120 female town employees. She offered town employment statistics, which showed women confined to clerical and secretarial positions. Only 5 of 30 principals and vice-principals were women and those were elementary school principals. She said that the library was the only exception for employment. She also noted the library card issue. Carpentier said that she and her women’s consciousness raising group compiled the statistics in less than 24 hours. The commission voted to ask the library to change its requirement to allow women to be recognized as Miss or Mrs. Using their own name when applying for a card, and after some negotiation, they did. Ann Bandazian, president of the Central Connecticut Chapter of NOW spoke, commended the Commission on having the hearing. She asked that the Commission fight to “remove male and female qualifications from job descriptions, pay equal pay for equal jobs and eliminate marital status from job applications.” Bandazian went on to say that she believed the three most important issues for women in 1972 were the right to “free abortion on demand,” ending educational and employment discrimination, and universal, voluntary day care. Anne Streeter, the President of the League of Women Voters was the third speaker. Streeter agreed with Bandazian about day care and employment, particularly in meaningful full time jobs. She also made a more subtle argument by saying “If you were to stop the average woman in a supermarket and ask her if she was being discriminated against, she would say no. She would say no until she went out and tried to get a good job. Discrimination is not always something overt. Discrimination can be something lacking, rather than something obviously done.” But the case that drew the most attention was one brought by eight women hired in July 1971 to be fire and police dispatchers. The women claimed that they were paid less than the men they replaced, that they should be paid double on holidays, and that they had been harassed. Before they were hired, regular fire and police personnel were the dispatchers and received the pay of police and firefighters. The women believed they deserved the same pay. By 1973, their pay ranged between $6,700 and $7,900 while the firemen dispatchers had made from $9,600 to $11,500. Within four months of employment in November 1971, the eight women complained to the state Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities. The Town Council’s General Government and Finance Committee, chaired by Chuck Matties concluded, after meeting with the Fire and Police Chiefs, that there was no bias or harassment. Fire Chief Yaccavone claimed that the women were well aware of their working conditions before they took their jobs. Their salaries and benefits met those of dispatchers in other towns. Matties said that the job description was not listed as a “woman’s job.” Corporation Counsel Ed Hebb said he had found no evidence of the women being harassed. The state Commission on Human Rights disagreed. Their field representative Frances Goodale believed that the there was “reasonable cause” to believe that West Hartford violated the state’s Fair Employment Practices Act. Their salaries were about $2,400 less than those of the men who worked before them. Goodale believed the women could get $25,000 in back pay. Goodale said that in fact the job had been posted as a “woman’s job” and that the town needed to follow the FEPA. Eleven days later, on October 20, the Hartford Courant reported that Corporation Counsel met with Goodale in a conciliatory conference, which lasted for 2 ½ hours, but did not reach any conclusion. The women kept up their fight and the next September got a hearing before a Human Rights Commission tribunal, a group of men selected by the Governor. If the tribunal decided in the women’s favor, they could be awarded $48,000 in back wages. Town Manager Richard Custer claimed this would be a real hardship on the town because of the tight budget. Almost a year later, the case was still not settled. In January 1974, the Human Rights Commission finally heard the case. The Commission ruled against the Town of West Hartford and ordered back pay for the female dispatchers. The Town then appealed the decision and Judge William Graham of the Hartford Court of Common Pleas ruled that the town’s hiring favored women and the change in pay was aimed at saving money. After that decision, the town estimated they had saved $175,000 in back pay. Final legal arguments were presented in April 1974. The town argued they changed the job description to “operator” after town officials decided to eliminate the position of fire dispatcher. According to a June 13, 1974 Hartford Courant article, a 1970 study by the town of West Hartford showed that the town could save money by hiring civilians rather than firefighters to be dispatchers. The Town’s position was that the men who did the job were overpaid. The Town believed that the present dispatcher pay should be decided by collective bargaining. The Supreme Court overturned the Court of Common Pleas’ ruling about back pay, though they agreed that the town discriminated against the women. But, they did not believe that the women should be given back pay. The women ably challenged the town for their rights and made their point, but there would be no back pay. They won the moral battle, but got no remuneration for their win. Nan Streeter, who was Mayor from 1975 to 1979, remembered women being frustrated with their jobs and pay during that period of time, but as mayor, she also knew that low pay for women helped to balance the budget. Employment for women has changed tremendously over the past 40 years. No longer are there separate listings for male and female, though the jobs of secretaries and clerks remain almost exclusively in female hands. In 2011 West Hartford has a female superintendent of schools. Still, the five secondary school principals are men, with six women vice principals out of eleven. In the elementary schools, eight of the eleven have women principals and 11 of 12 elementary curriculum specialists and vice principals are female. These assumptions about who is fit for the job and thus what they are paid have strong roots in the town. West Hartford and the Mississippi Freedom Summer Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, June 2013 Bring the nation’s children, and the parents will have to focus on Mississippi, our thinking ran. And if the parents raised their voices, the political establishment would be forced to listen. – Bob Moses, recounting Freedom Summer, 2001 In late June 1964, West Hartford’s Susan Gladstone, 20, a student at Pembroke College (now part of Brown University) went to Clarksdale, Mississippi as part of the Mississippi Freedom Summer Project to register African American voters, teach in a “Negro Freedom School,” and help build the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. A 1962 Conard High School graduate, she had joined the Northern Student Movement to register Mississippi voters. While in Clarksdale, she stayed with an African American family. The Congress of Federated Organizations (SNCC, SCLC, and CORE) organized the Freedom Summer Project which recruited over 800 northern college students to work on voting and education. Leader Bob Moses believed that the students could bring much needed publicity and protection to the African Americans who were already doing this work in Mississippi. As white violence toward Blacks increased in 1964, organizers thought that the white workers could help their cause. Susan Gladstone arrived in Clarksdale with The Project, and met Police Chief Ben Collins, who she described as a “vicious man.” By July 11th, 100 African Americans had tried to register to vote, but only one succeeded by passing the literacy test. The town administered literacy tests designed to stop blacks from qualifying to vote, and the Confederate flag stickers adorned courthouses doors where voters registered and were given the literacy test. Chief Collins “ordered Negroes not to try” and ordered the students to leave Clarksdale, according to the Hartford Courant. Back in West Hartford, Gladstone’s parents, Dr. and Mrs. James E. Gladstone, were not so reassured that their daughter was safe, and still they supported her civil rights work. James’s 2007 obituary describes him as devoted to “causes of underserved people and all forms of progressive politics.” But, like hundreds of student activists’ parents, they were concerned for her safety. From their point of view, they found it “hard to believe that sort of thing [stopping registration] can go on in the United States.” In 1960, Mississippi and Connecticut were miles apart in terms of wealth and educational levels of residents. Mississippi held the distinction as the poorest state in the nation, and Connecticut as one of the wealthiest. In Mississippi, 86% of Black families lived below the national poverty line. Blacks made up only 5% of the registered voters, but comprised 45% of the state’s population. Whites argued that Blacks had no interest in voting. Blacks worried they would lose their job if they registered. Before arriving in Mississippi, Gladstone traveled to Oxford, Ohio where she learned voter registration tactics, the history of Mississippi and the strategy of nonviolence. She trained with Andrew Goodman and Mickey Schwerner and then traveled south on June 20, 1964. The very next day, June 21, three Ku Klux Klansmen murdered organizers James Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner.During that summer of 1964, more than 60 black churches, businesses, schools, and homes were bombed or burned. Gladstone’s parents helped realize Moses’ idea that white students would bring with them concerned white parents and more press. Since 1960, at least 12 civil rights activists had been murdered, but news did not spread outside of Mississippi. When the white students arrived, as Moses predicted, the national journalists began to pay attention. The FBI sent hundreds of agents to the state, to investigate, but not protect these activists. Five FBI agents went to Clarksdale. Susan’s sister Andi, who was 16 in 1964, remembered her parents receiving numerous phone calls from Clarksdale threatening that they would kill Susan for the work she was doing in Clarksdale. Andi remembered hearing her parents crying in the other room during Susan’s time in Mississippi. Gladstone’s parents and their daughter Andi, along with other students’ parents from the northeast, travelled to Washington D.C. on July 1 and 2 hoping to meet with President Lyndon Johnson, seeking more federal protection for their daughter and the other civil rights workers in Mississippi. They called themselves the Parents’ Mississippi Emergency Committee and were joined by parents from New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. The West Hartford Committee members also included Mrs. Roydon Berger (parent of Robert), Mrs. Paul Landerman (parent of Dick), and Mr. and Mrs. I.M. Chaikin (parents of Henry), all West Hartford parents of students working in Mississippi. The parents quickly arranged the trip after the three civil rights workers went missing. On July 1, the parents met with U.S. Senator Thomas Dodd and Asst. Atty. Gen. John Doar (father of West Hartford Town Councillor Burke Doar) from the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. Doar did not suggest to the parents that their children return home. Doar said, “We all accept the fact that there is danger there, as did our sons and daughters when they set out. Asking anything like that would have let them down miserably. They have a very deep commitment to what they are doing.” The movement continued. On July 2, 1964, Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, prohibiting discrimination in public places, providing for schools and other public accommodations to be integrated, and making it illegal to discriminate by race in employment. This Civil Rights Act, the first to be passed since Reconstruction, came after months of lobbying bolstered by the August 1963 March on Washington. The students continued their work, but with much more media coverage and federal protection for the movement. Mississippi continued to fight the changes and Governor Paul Johnson urged “non-compliance [of the Civil Rights Act] until the whole gamut of the law is tested in the courts.” To fight the Governor’s power, student volunteers helped to establish the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), which attempted to unseat the state’s all-white regular delegation at the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City. Although the Democratic Party ultimately seated Mississippi’s regular delegation, the MFDP’s bid for recognition raised awareness of voter discrimination in the Deep South and helped secure passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Andi Gladstone remembered going with her parents to Atlantic City in August 1964 to the Democratic Convention where the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party tried to be seated. She remembers staying up all night at a vigil and being supported by an African American man named Bayard Rustin, the organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. According to Andi, Susan was so moved by her work that she dropped out of Pembroke and stayed on in Clarksdale for at least another six months. She returned to West Hartford and then enrolled at the University of Wisconsin and graduated two years later. After her graduation she went to Antioch University where she earned her teaching degree. She moved to Washington DC to teach junior high school in the late 1960s where she met her husband Art Ellison. They moved to New Hampshire where she worked with battered women and then became a vocal AIDS activist before she died of that disease in 1992. Even though, in the 1960’s, there were some residents in West Hartford who worked to keep African Americans out of town, simultaneously, West Hartford’s youth, supported by their families, became warriors for justice in a very dangerous time. Gladstone’s courage in taking the trip to Mississippi showed her what it meant to fight for justice, and the value that the right to vote held in this nation. Her presence in Mississippi helped push the civil rights agenda, and was a part of creating this nation’s history. Susan’s sister said that experience “made her rock solid in her beliefs” about justice. Gladstone’s papers at the Wisconsin Historical Society include diaries, letters and an interview. Her name appears in two books on civil rights workers in Mississippi and in several Hartford Courant articles. Project Concern and Educational Opportunity Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, June 2001 It is one thing to be ideologically committed to equality of educational opportunity as a right and not as a privilege. It is yet another to intelligently implement programs that will in fact insure the practice of this ideal. – Charles Richter, Superintendent of West Hartford Public Schools, 1966 Before the first Hartford students boarded buses to West Hartford in 1966 as part of Project Concern, the town wrestled with what role it wanted to play in providing equal educational opportunity for all children. Strong leadership by West Hartford’s superintendent, and federal and state support helped Project Concern succeed in West Hartford - but not without a fight. In 1960, West Hartford had a total of 25 students of color out of a school population of over 6,000 students, less than one percent of the population. The city of Hartford had many elementary schools with over 85 percent minority and a large majority living in poverty. Just six years before, the Supreme Court decided that separate but equal schools by law (de jure) were inherently unequal. Some Hartford area residents decided that they needed to address the fact that separate schools by housing patterns (de facto) did not provide equal opportunity for all. In 1964, Hartford area business, education and political leaders gathered in a meeting to support cross-town busing with the “Meeting of Tomorrow.” This group commissioned a study that became known as the Harvard Report. Junior high school students from Hartford’s north end, the report found, were one and a half years behind the national average in math and reading. The Connecticut State Department of Education, supported by the Hartford Board of Education, wrote a grant to develop a voluntary interdistrict-busing program and called it Project Concern. They submitted the grant to the Office of Economic Opportunity under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By 1965, they hoped 300 Hartford students could participate in an attempt at educational and social integration, to promote educational equality of opportunity. Some West Hartford residents wanted to participate in the program. On April 14, 1966, 1,200 people attended a public hearing at Conard High School and stayed for a seven hour meeting. The West Hartford News claimed that the meeting was “the most passionate meeting in West Hartford’s history.” Many who opposed the bussing program came to the meeting. One West Hartford resident argued that equal educational opportunity was a right by contending that he had “worked hard for 40 years so he could have his kids educated in West Hartford. No one bused me here.” An African American teacher from Hartford reacted by saying “a Negro child does not belong in West Hartford” after she heard the racist attitudes at the meeting. A Hall High School student who spoke in favor of the bussing program was told to “go to Weaver” if he wanted an integrated school. The issue of local autonomy loomed large in the view of the opposition. West Hartford residents used the umbrella term of “neighborhood schools” to “protect” their local district. They believed that busing was the first step to losing autonomy and jurisdiction through an interdistrict program. Others argued that black students would bring down the level of educational attainment for white students in the classroom. Equality of educational opportunity, they argued, would lower achievement levels for all. But there were also strong advocates of the program. The pro-Project Concern Committee of New Education Opportunities was formed with both Christian and Jewish support. Rabbi Abraham Feldman, from Temple Beth Israel, a founder of the group, went to the public hearings and clearly expressed his support for the interdistrict-busing program for both educational and social reasons. Superintendent of Schools Charlie Richter wholeheartedly supported the program. He believed that West Hartford should be a leader in the Hartford area because, he felt, it would improve the already excellent educational system here. He argued the day after the Board of Education made their decision, “If West Hartford can’t do it (Project Concern), then no one can.” On April 18, 1966 just four days after the public hearing, the Board of Education voted to accept Project Concern “in principle.” West Hartford would not incur any cost for the program because Hartford footed the bill through federal and private grant monies. The Board of Education boldly accepted the challenge, and chose to start by integrating their 1966 summer school. But, West Hartford’s commitment was only to this short-term trial. The state approached West Hartford, Manchester, Farmington and Glastonbury to participate in the program. West Hartford was the first town to agree to the educational experiment. Glastonbury refused to participate with the other three after a tie vote on the Board of Education denied their participation. South Windsor and Simsbury also became part of this original group. But, the opposition was strong. By early June, West Hartford opponents gathered 4,287 signatures on a petition to make the Board’s policy null and void. However, their petition failed because it was illegal for the Town Council to stop a Board of Education decision. The opponents threatened to sue the board for their use of “excessive power.” This too failed. On Tuesday, July 5, 1966, 250 Project Concern students entered West Hartford’s Summer School and it went very smoothly. Money from Title IV of the 1964 Civil Rights Act ($270,000) and the Ford Foundation ($50,000) helped fund the summer program. In August, the Board of Education voted to extend the bussing program to the regular school year with kindergarten through fifth grade students. The State Department of Education got $470,000 from Title I and Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to carry out the regular school year program. On September 4, 1966, 80 Hartford students entered West Hartford’s elementary schools, the most of any of the participating towns. Extensive studies of the project continued into the 1970s and 1980s. Each of the studies documented the benefits for both the Hartford and West Hartford students. Though not every student chose to remain in the program, those who did showed increased academic achievement and increased social interactions. Parents of children in classrooms with Project Concern students became supporters of the program while those who had no direct contact often continued their opposition. Rights and privileges are ideas constantly in conflict in a democracy. If equality of educational opportunity is a right, who carries it out and how is it done? When students have unequal abilities, unequal motivation, and unequal knowledge, can there be equal opportunity? These thorny issues are fraught with tensions and continue to be discussed in West Hartford today. The issue of neighborhood schools and local autonomy in light of the state racial diversity act continue to challenge the town to address whether equal educational opportunity is a right or a privilege. In 1966, both political, religious and educational leadership in town saw it as a right. Moral Voices in West Hartford Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, September 2007 In 1966, West Hartford embarked on a path to offer educational opportunity to Hartford students by participating in Project Concern. The moral voice that emanated from the faith community provided a moral voice for policy makers in town as it helped to galvanize the community. The impact the religious community had on public policy in West Hartford has varied over the years. When the town was founded in the early 18th century, the church and the government were one and not until 1818 did the state government separate the Congregational Church from its public role by disestablishing the church. In West Hartford, until the 1850s, there was one church in town –- the First Congregational Church. And, for the first 100 years of our history as a town, that church continued to hold a privileged place. In the early 1950s, with over 5,000 members, it was named one of the 10 most influential and successful churches in the country. In the spring of 1966, just nine years after the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, West Hartford’s Board of Education voted to participate in the busing of 75 elementary age Hartford students to West Hartford. Manchester, Farmington, South Windsor and Simsbury joined the group. Project Concern was the first program of its kind in the country and was financed by national, state and Hartford funds. On April 1, 1966, a committee of 50 formed the West Hartford Committee for Educational Opportunity to “draw to this cause as many as will come from the ranks of the thinking citizens of West Hartford… people who are willing to take a first step in the direction of providing equal educational opportunities for all children, regardless of color.” Rabbi Abraham Feldman and several ministers founded the group. This in turn was followed by a vote of the executive board of the Webster Hill School’s Parent Teacher Organization to hold a referendum on the busing on April 6. The Web Hill community expressed concern that West Hartford would not be able to “maintain our educational standards” if Hartford students were bussed here. However, the law did not allow for a referendum. In the first week of April, The Reverend John P. Webster, pastor of the First Church of Christ Congregation sent out letters to his congregation urging them to “get the facts” on the busing program. He strongly supported Project Concern and encouraged his parishioners to go to a public hearing and write a letter to Superintendent of Schools Charlie Richter to express their support for the project. In his letter, he quoted Rabbi Feldman, the convener of the West Hartford clergy group, that the whole program could “be dismissed or rejected unless there is some effective public opinion imparted to the Board of Education and the superintendent.” Webster went on to write, “Ironically, someone said that there would be no word from the synagogues or churches on this matter because their people are involved with Passover and Easter. The Passover celebrates the sparing of an oppressed people for their escape from bondage. Easter celebrates the triumphant victory of Jesus Christ and His way over the forces of destruction and death.” On April 15, Rev. Kingsland Van Winkle of the Trinity Church, Hartford sent letters to his West Hartford parishioners urging them to support the regional desegregation plan by calling Board of Education members and the superintendent of schools. He argued that this project was a “very small but extremely significant attempt to achieve the sense of oneness which all of us feel is so essential to metropolitan living.” On that same night, Rabbi Feldman spoke at a public hearing at Conard in front of 1,200 townspeople. He was booed, hissed, and catcalled. Someone shouted, “Take your congregation and go home.” At the end of his talk, the audience rose in a standing ovation amid boos from some audience members. On April 18, the Hartford Courant reported that West Hartford church leaders used their pulpits to sharply criticize the behavior of some town residents at the public hearing at Conard. The Roman Catholic clergy made a joint statement deploring “the vicious display of intemperate and abusive bigotry by some of our fellow citizens… That any minister of religion should have been booed and hissed here in West Hartford after expressing his convictions on this issue violates every norm of common courtesy, shamefully disgraces our entire community a makes a mockery of Christian charity.” Rev. Wallace Grant Fiske, minister of the Universalist Church read an “open letter” to Rabbi Feldman, praising him for his public stance and denouncing the crowd. Fiske praised Feldman for his “mature, constructive leadership…” As a reaction to the controversy, “stand-by mothers” organized to offer themselves as neighbors to the north end families involved in the busing program. Mrs. Alice Doyle and Mrs. Charlotte Kitowski led the group and sent a letter to the north end churches. Already, 32 families signed up to act as neighbors who could help out in case of emergency or illness in an attempt “to work together, to open up one more opportunity for our children, so that when they grow up, they won’t feel so apart.” Just one week after the tumultuous meeting at Conard, 30 people went to a “Meeting of Concern” at the Elmwood Community Church to discuss the effects of the busing program. Ministers, representatives of the West Hartford public schools, the Hartford Board of Education, teachers, students, and citizens of the town attended. Hartford Board of Education member Dr. Lewis Fox told the group, “Something wonderful has happened in West Hartford. The one organized force in town was the combined churches and synagogues…” The ideals of the clergy won the day as Hartford students attended summer school that summer and then 75 took the buses on September 7, 1966 to West Hartford schools. The opponents of school integration continued to show their disapproval. On December 16, the publisher of the Hartford Times, who lived on Whetten Road, woke up to find a glass bottle filled with rags dipped in gasoline thrown through a window in his house. This followed a similar incident with Hartford’s Mayor George Kinsella and came after the Hartford Human Relations Commission received an anonymous note in which threats were made to those perceived to be supporting school integration. The 2007 Supreme Court ruling in McFarland v. Jefferson County Public Schools rejected the use of a student’s race in student assignment plans. This comes at a time when segregation rates for racial minorities are on the rise. West Hartford is a case in point. In 2007, the elementary schools are more segregated than they have ever been. What role do political and religious leaders play on this issue today? On September 4, 2007, about 75 Hartford students enrolled in Project Choice came to school in West Hartford. Is the sentiment in 2007 more like that of the clergy in 1966 or the Webster Hill PTO in 1966? West Hartford Education Association at 50 November 2015 On November 10, 1965, 539 out of 660 West Hartford teachers voted to have the West Hartford Education Association be the sole representative for West Hartford public school teachers. This gave the association the power to negotiate contracts with the West Hartford Board of Education. At that moment, the “Association” became a union with the ability to collectively bargain with the Board of Education. Though an affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers existed in West Hartford, they did not challenge the WHEA in this election. Before the Association had the legal standing as a union, the Superintendent, Charles Richter met with each teacher individually and had them sign their contract as an individual. Teachers had no say in working conditions, and no protections of their rights. For instance, In the 1960s, a woman who was pregnant had to quit teaching when she “showed.” And, the Board of Education made a rule that upon turning 65, a teacher had to retire. Teachers found the “merit pay” idea unfair as the award of the extra $400 per year seemed to be based on loyalty to the administration. The Association’s power came through public persuasion and bringing lawsuits against the Board of Education as in the 1963 Herzig case. Fred Herzig, a teacher at Conard High School was forced to retire when he reached the age of 65. The courts found that he had the right to remain teaching. There was much upheaval in the West Hartford Public Schools in the 1960s in a time of rapid growth in the system. The Board of Education forced Superintendent Ed Thorne to retire after 16 years in the job in 1963. In 1964, the Board hired Charles O. Richter to replace Thorne. Richter came with the reputation of being innovative, full of energy, and by many accounts very strong willed and overbearing. He and the Board of Education believed they should have sole decision making ability over contracts and working conditions. This set the scene for a four year battle to get a written contract. The vote for collective bargaining was long in the making. The WHEA began in 1928 as the West Hartford Teachers’ Association, an association of professionals. Soon thereafter, in 1935, the National Labor Relations Act, also known as the Wagner Act became the law of the land, allowing workers in the private sector to collectively bargain. It was not until 1962 when John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 10998, that federal public employees earned the right to collectively bargain. Connecticut’s Legislature passed Public Law 10-153 in 1965 giving teachers the right to join and elect an organization and then establish a bargaining unit in negotiations with their board of education. In 1965, West Hartford teachers did just that. But just having the Association represent them was only the start. The WHEA leadership then began to bargain for a written contract. It took four years, a lawsuit, a proposed slow-down by the teachers, hundreds of hours of negotiations, mediators and arbitrators to negotiate a written contract. Attempts for a written contract started in earnest a year after the vote, when in November 1966, Representative Council voted unanimously to seek a written contract. Supt. Richter wrote to WHEA President Janice Falcon, stating his support. Richter was a tough cookie. Falcon could match him. She was elected president three times and she got the first written contract. In 2015 she was still alive but not willing to be interviewed at age 94, though we did have one phone conversation. She seemed like the leader the teachers needed at that moment. Teachers wanted to negotiate working conditions, grievance procedures and insurance, as well as salaries. But 1966 proved to be a year full of contentious issues for the Board and the Superintendent. School busing from Hartford – Project Concern – began in summer school that year, voters turned down a referendum to build a new Hall High, and the union helped Wolcott teachers voice their grievances about an overbearing principal. Negotiations hit an impasse because Superintendent Richter wanted to retain the power to be the final arbiter of all grievances. In May 1967, the Board of Education chair Edward Mosehauer said “I’m willing to negotiate with them, but the Board of Education runs this school system and that is not going to change.” By June, 1967, no agreements had been reached about a written contract, and the WHEA encouraged teachers not to sign their individual contracts. 400 teachers refused to sign. By October 1967, the Hartford Courant reported that the contract talks had ended in failure after a 15 hour mediation session and the negotiation would go to arbitration. WHEA President Falkin asked both the Connecticut Education Association and the National Education Association to investigate the contract impasse over working conditions, accumulated sick days, release time for the WHEA President, and grievance procedures. Salary schedules had already been agreed to. The CEA report, released in January 1968 claimed that a tough administration caused unrest among the staff. Very quickly, arbitration hit a snag. The Board of Education chose Willis Parsons to be their arbitrator. He was the Board of Education chair until 1965 and then became Superintendent Richter’s personal attorney. The WHEA brought suit against the Board and won in February 1968, with the court arguing that Parsons could not be impartial. With a win under their belt, but still no contract, the WHEA and the Board of Education attempted to negotiate once more. In the summer of 1968, teachers voted again not to sign their salary agreements. The WHEA came up with a set of issues on which they would “slow down” for the two days at the end of school after students finished to try to pressure the Board. In return, the Board of Education threatened to withhold half of their June salaries if they participated in the “3 day boycott.” The Board did not issue paychecks on June 15. That same day, the state education commissioner stepped in and helped the two sides reach an agreement. The teachers called off their slowdown. On July 3, 1968 the teachers signed their first written contract for one year. It took 17 months to negotiate. But, the troubled relationships between the union and the Board and Superintendent did not end here. In 1969, the Board of Education chose to test the new Teacher Negotiation Act passed by the state legislature in 1969. This new law forced Boards of Education to negotiate on many more working conditions. The WHEA wanted to negotiate a contract with the Board of Education for both teachers and administrators. Even though they had settled the salaries, the negotiations went to arbitration and a three man arbitration panel came up with a package. After 22 failed negotiation sessions, and failed mediation, the Board, led by chair John Hand Conard, rejected the proposal. New WHEA President Dick Blaisdell said the Board was running roughshod over the teachers. Even into October, the Board of Education, and John Hand Conard, tried to keep total control over working conditions and keep salaries at what they considered to be a reasonable level. But the new law made it necessary for the Board to negotiate all areas of teachers’ employment. June 27 was an all-day mediation at the state office of education. At year’s end, the two sides had still not agreed on the contract. And into 1970, Richter continued to hold on to his belief that he could unilaterally decide on working conditions. The WHEA responded by printing a Superintendent’s report card in the Hartford Courant in April 1970, giving him six “F’s”. It wasn’t until September, when the teachers were already back at school until both sides agreed to a new contract, 15 months after negotiating started. Many factors contributed to their first contracts, one of the most important being the role of federal government in allowing public employees to collectively bargain, and then the Connecticut State Law which allowed for the bargaining of working conditions as well as pay. The union’s solidarity, their willingness to stand up to the power of the Board of Education, and their superintendent who at the least would be called headstrong, gave union members the role models to stand up for what is fair. The union leadership was brazen and forceful in standing up for teachers’ rights. The binding arbitration law of 1979 changed these long drawn out negotiations and some in administration realized that in fact the union makes the school system even stronger. And yet unions continue to be under attack. The Supreme Court will hear a case in 2016 called Fredericks v. California that will allow employees to not have an agency fee. Teachers only have these rights if they continue to fight for them. Gordon Bennett Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, November 2009 When the Noah Webster House had a fundraiser at the Brace Road Fire Department in the late 1990s, Gordon Bennett, a founder and benefactor of the Noah Webster House Foundation, got in the rescue cherry picker and scaled three stories to its full height. This didn’t surprise those in attendance who knew Bennett, but some young observers, worried about this 91 year old on this new adventure. Gordon Bennett loves life and embodies the type of active community member that makes West Hartford such a vibrant community. He turned 100 on November 6, 2009. His economic and civic involvement has made West Hartford a better place. According to resident Booker DeVaughan, Bennett is a “complete gentleman, and West Hartford has benefited much from good works and dedication to the town.” Gordon Bennett first appeared in public documents in the Hartford Courant, on its society page where it was noted: “Dec. 18, 1931, Mr. Charles W. Bennett and Mr. Gordon Bennett, sons of Mr. and Mrs. Charles J. Bennett of North Oxford Street, Hartford, “will return Saturday from Union College, Schenectady, NY.” He graduated from Union with a degree in engineering. He remained loyal to his alma mater in his role by 1947 as the Secretary of Connecticut’s Union College Alumni Association. Today, Bennett is Union’s oldest living class agent and he recently received an award for fundraising. After graduating with an engineering degree from Union, Bennett worked with his father who served as the Connecticut State Highway Commissioner. His father Charles W. Bennett was the second highway commissioner in Connecticut. Gordon talked about how, in the 1920s, when the highway was built from Hartford to New London in the 1920s and 30s, Bennett remembers that the road had many curves because it had to follow the landscape. There was no money to blast through hills or build bridges. Though he and his father were Republicans, they worked for Democratic Governor Wilbur Cross to build the Merritt Parkway. Cross hired them because Bennett’s father was one of the prominent highway engineers of his day. By the late 1930s, Bennett married and had two daughters and moved from Hartford to Whiting Lane. Bennett remembered, “that was the place to be back then… it was a wonderful town. And you didn’t have to cross the river.” When Bennett’s father died in 1941, Gordon was 32 years old and ready to go out on his own. He worked for Vulcan Radiator Company as an executive vice president and then moved onto to a ten-year stint at Hartford Empire Company (later Emhart) where he was export sales manager and glass plant manager. This is when Bennett began to travel the world, and for this job he did most of his traveling in Asia, South America, Western Europe, and Scandinavia. Bennett was on the cutting edge of the global economy. World trade was part of his life in the 1940s and 1950s. According to the Hartford Courant, in March 1952, at age 43, Bennett, Granville Shattuck and Helen Sanborn, all experienced in foreign trade, opened a company called New England Overseas Corporation at 12 LaSalle Road. They managed export businesses for Connecticut small machine tools firms who did not have foreign trade department. In 1957, Bennett became President of Whitlock Manufacturing Company, a principal supplier to rapidly expanding plastics, gasoline, synthetic fiber and atomic power industries. Whitlock Manufacturing came to West Hartford in 1891 when Walter Goodwin persuaded the company to locate on South Street along the railroad tracks. They bent pipe, preheated by steam for car radiators, water heaters and made giant water turbines for the Gatun Dam in Panama. Later they made storage heaters and tubular heat exchangers for laundries, textile plants, hotels and other large users of hot water. During World War II, Whitlock got involved in the Manhattan Project and supplied specially designed systems for nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers. By 1963, Bennett was president of the company and between 1962 and 1963, profits tripled. Bennett’s family moved to Hilltop Drive. On his daily commute down South Main Street each day, he drove by Noah Webster’s birthplace. Fred Hamilton owned the house, though he and his wife had moved to the house just to its north. The Hamiltons and Bennetts were family friends, and as the story goes, in 1962, Bennett persuaded the Hamilton family to donate the house to the town. The town did not take the initiative to do anything to the house and it began to deteriorate. This is when Bennett stepped in. Bennett, a business leader in town, used his contacts and his ability to sell. He convinced others to start the Noah Webster House Foundation and to raise money and restore the house. His friend, Dick Crampton served on the Town Council and took up the cause as well. According to Joan Warner, a founder of the Foundation, Gordon was a true leader in getting people to work with him and volunteer to move the project forward. When they started in 1965, they had $280. The restored house opened to the public in 1968. It attracted visitors from all over and distinguished itself with its school programs. By 1974, they needed more room and Gordon was instrumental in adding the museum portion of the building. His role as supporter and benefactor is built on his love for community and for history. He is a self-proclaimed history buff. Initiating the Noah Webster House is not his only service to the town. By the mid 1960s, Bennett was a director of the Rotary and member of the Chamber of Commerce. He was active in Republican politics and served on the Town Committee. In the 1970s when he retired, he served as a director on the Seniors Job Bank and as vice-president of the Noah Webster House. He continued to be involved with the Rotary and the Noah Webster House in 2009. When Bennett retired, he and his wife continued to travel for another 20 years. He says he has traveled to 100 countries through work and play. When Bennett traveled, he was always happy to return to West Hartford, which he deems “a very lovely town, and very well run.” He says this friendly town has not changed a great deal in its manner, even though the population has grown substantially since the 1930s. Bennett’s commitment to West Hartford has helped to solidify this town as a great place to live, learn and work. Happy 100th birthday Gordon!! Piper Brook Redevelopment Project Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, September 2001 Like most changes in West Hartford, the redevelopment of the Piper Brook area in the 1960s and 1970s was full of conflict. Piper Brook is in the southeast corner of West Hartford, bounded by New Britain Avenue on the north, Hillcrest Avenue on the east, the Newington town line on the south, and South Street to the west. It totaled 155 acres, and in 1970 was 30% of the town’s industrial zone. Until 1924, the Piper Brook area was residential, including houses along Rose Avenue and a few on Custer and South Streets. In 1924, when West Hartford adopted its first zoning laws, the zoning commission zoned this area industrial. Soon industrial buildings and warehouses were squeezed onto small residential lots. The area, according to George Cunningham, who lived in the Piper Brook neighborhood since 1940, was characterized more by vacant lots than anything else. Its clay soil led to problems with sewage and sanitary conditions. Small lots and frequent floods discouraged businesses and families from settling there. Much of the area was swampland. Every spring floods came up as far as South Street. In the flood of ’55, water reached as far as the properties on New Britain Avenue. During World War II, tents comprising an anti-aircraft encampment adorned the vacant lots of the Piper Brook area. Those in the barracks were there to warn citizens of attacks from the Germans. By 1956, West Hartford established a Development Commission whose job was to increase the tax base of the town and encourage industrial growth in the form of office buildings, research labs and apartment buildings. The town yearned for a development like that of Connecticut General in Bloomfield. In 1962, the town hired a firm to survey the Piper Brook area for development. In 1965 a land use study found 132 houses needed to be relocated and the area needed flood control. The firm submitted this information to the Urban Renewal Administration, a federal agency established under Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society programs. Historically, back as far as the 1930s, West Hartford was not reluctant to take advantage of federal funds for building projects in town. Under Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, West Hartford built its Town Hall and library, a pool at Beachland Park and sewers for Farmington Avenue. In the 1960s, federal money flowed again, and the town applied for money from Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The federal government had a concern for what they considered to be “blighted areas.” Because the Piper Brook area had mixed uses with residential structures next to industrial ones, they considered there to be “a great potential as a future blighted area regardless of the condition of the structures today.” This made the entire Piper Brook area eligible for federal urban renewal funds. Their idea was to save as many commercial buildings as possible, move the residences and build new dwellings so that residents would be separate from the industrial district. In November 1966, West Hartford residents defeated a bond referendum for 20% of the cost of the project at the polls. George Cunningham believed that fear motivated the voters. Many families had lived in the area for years and felt a sense of security in their neighborhoods. They attended the local church and their houses were paid for. Some heard that they would be compensated only by the original price of their homes and would be left alone to find new housing. Cunningham helped organize the Piper Brook Boosters Association to try and make the residents a part of the renewal project. He knew all the neighbors and he served on the Project Area Committee. Through this community organization, Cunningham galvanized support for the project. Two years later, in November 1968, voters approved a revised municipal bond. The federal government grant of $4.5 million was approved in December of that year. And, the town gave the town almost $1 million in funds for the project. The plans included building a 96-unit apartment building, realigning the Piper Brook channel, the construction of a new Rose Avenue with 33 residential lots, and building the infrastructure with town utilities. By 1970, 73 project area families were interested in relocating to these new apartments. One of the purposes of the subdivision was to make a place for the residents of Rose Avenue to relocate. The plan was to move some of the houses and build some new houses. The second phase of the project included fixing the interior streets in the project area by putting in town sewers and town water and rehabbing some of the 75 commercial buildings in the area. According to the original plans, the project would be completed by 1973. However, the project did not go without a hitch. By January 1971, the West Hartford Redevelopment agency had approved William E. and Beverly Curry of Hartford as the developers. The apartments, to be built on Hillcrest Avenue, were for moderate-income families. In March 1971, HUD eased its standards by allowing more one family apartments to be built than were normally allowed in federally funded housing. But by April 8, Curry still had not secured the $1 million bond that he had assured the town he could get. He had to be removed from the project and the town had to find a new developer. A zoning battle and trouble with town administrators continued to slow down the project, but in December 1971 building began, and by the summer of 1972, residents moved in. In 1973, Education-Instruccion Inc. (E/I), a Hartford civil rights action group, filed a complaint with the Connecticut Community Development Program, claiming that continued work on the Piper Brook Redevelopment Project violated civil rights laws and state statutes prohibiting state agencies from discrimination. E/I stated that the moneys were used “to insulate and isolate and retrench suburban growth from the problems of the core cities.” Nothing substantive came of these claims, but it did alert area residents to the segregation in the cities and pushed local officials to think about whether they were meeting the established purposes of the federal money. In 1975, infrastructure work continued. The Redevelopment Agency came back to the town for another $2.6 million to complete work on streets in the area. By early 1977, the town bought the $2.3 million mortgage from HUD. George Cunningham criticized the move, arguing the town would never complete the project. The town hoped sale of remaining land would help them pay off the mortgage. Cunningham claimed that the cost of a parcel of land had tripled since the town took over the mortgage. At this point, the town closed out the project, disbanded the Redevelopment Agency and the executive director was no longer an employee of the town. Newspaper articles in 1977 alluded to a change in the federal government requirements for federal redevelopment monies. The feds combined Urban Renewal grants with others into the HUD Community Block Grant program. This program required the town to build 192 new units of low and moderate income housing in three years. The Republican led Town Council feared that the town was losing control over its own destiny under the federal program. Councilor Bob Farr spoke out most strongly against the federal mandate, according to the Hartford Times. He suggested building only 100 units for the elderly and rehabbing units in existence. By 1977, the value of the 20 unsold parcels of land was half its 1970 value, but town officials were eager to sell it to get it back on the tax rolls. They hoped that because they bought the mortgage from the federal government that restrictions placed on the land by HUD could be eased, making purchase and development easier. The Piper Brook Redevelopment project illustrates the often contentious relationship between federal, state and local governments, the clash between the interests of city and suburb, and residents and industries. By 2001, almost 35 years after the first plans, the area is a bustling commercial and industrial district. The Piper Brook apartments are full and the new community center sponsored by federal and town money has helped build the community that would please George Cunningham. Racial Balance Law Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, December 2009 On October 9, 2009, the Board of Education addressed West Hartford’s lack of compliance with the 1969 Racial Imbalance Law. A 2007 United States Supreme Court ruling, which threw out Seattle’s use of race to assign students to schools, has emboldened some Connecticut policymakers to question the constitutionality of the law. With the largest achievement gap of any state in the union, West Hartford is in the middle of the controversy over the efficacy of racial integration in schools. The West Hartford School Board’s commitment to school integration has ebbed and flowed with its superintendents. From 1966 to 1970, Superintendent Charlie Richter, supported interdistrict integration within the context of the migration of African Americans from south to north, the civil rights movement, and subsequent urban unrest, and Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society programs. On September 6, 1966, at West Hartford’s Fall Convocation, Superintendent Richter said: The West Hartford Board of Education attracted national attention during the 1965-66 school year when the Board of Education became the first to propose a program of mixing urban-suburban youngsters, the first to accept a controversial regional invitation to join with other towns in such a plan and the first to implement its own plan locally as part of the regular summer school program… Richter believed that integrating schools would attack poverty, and he wanted West Hartford to be part of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society, which addressed the roots of poverty. Although poverty was less visible in the 1960s, Richter argued, it was “no less real.” He believed, “in our society, poverty is still a problem and still exacts a price. And I believe that magnanimous Americans will reach down to lift up again.” The national, state, and local impetus to integrate schools in the Hartford region is still a policy issue in 2009. The federal No Child Left Behind Act requires school systems to educate all students and close the achievement gap. The state, through the Racial Balance Act (1969) and the Sheff v. O’Neill case (filed in 1989) asks for voluntary integration within school districts in the Hartford region. Within the town, a magnet/redistricting plan in 1995 tried to better balance the 11 elementary schools by establishing three elementary school magnets, and redrawing district lines. Segregated schools developed because of regionally segregated housing patterns for the many migrants to Connecticut and West Hartford from the 1950’s until today. Between 1950 and 1960, the African-American population in Connecticut more than doubled from 53,000 to 107,000. From 1960 to 1970, 80,000 Hispanics migrated to Connecticut. These migrants moved to cities at the same time that white middle class residents moved to the suburbs. In the 1950s and 1960s, Hartford factories closed and some, like Colt’s Firearms moved to the suburbs or south. Though the civil rights movement of the 1960s, was largely perceived as a southern event, cries for black power and civil rights activism flourished in Hartford as well. There was a growing militancy among new black leaders that galvanized the black community. Those who had lived through being second-class citizens lost some of their fear and willingly fought for their equal rights. According to Connecticut historian Herbert Janick, “black youths” looted Hartford’s North End in 1967, 1968, and 1969. In July and September 1967, frustrated and angry youths pillaged the north end. After Martin Luther King’s assassination in April 1968, North End teenagers threw rocks and bricks at police and firemen, chanting, “You killed Martin Luther King!” On Labor Day 1969, mobs fought state and city police. Those in the mob set fire to a public library and damaged almost 100 buildings. Over 500 people were arrested in this, the largest riot. These riots led to much soul searching on the part of the city, state and federal government. Johnson’s Great Society programs were based on addressing the deep seated causes of poverty and so jobs programs and educational programs were both implemented. City and state government reacted by pushing through summer camp and work experience programs for city youth. It is in that context that Connecticut’s General Assembly passed their Racial Imbalance Act in 1969, believing that a good education in an integrated setting could help the city’s poor succeed. In the 1960s, Hartford’s schools were about 50% white, so there was a chance for intradistrict integration. But, by time the Racial Balance Act was implemented, many Connecticut cities had more than 75% students of color in their schools, so believed the only way to integrate was by crossing district lines. In West Hartford, according to the 1960 census, 229 African Americans, 0.4% of the population lived here. By 1970, the number grew to 263, but stayed the same fraction of a percent of the population. Clearly, for Superintendent Richter, integration was an interdistrict issue in the mid 1960s. According to the Hartford Courant, the education committee in the state legislature rejected the first set of regulations for the racial imbalance law drawn up by the State Board of Education. In the ensuing years, the major Connecticut cities threatened lawsuits against the state. But, by the late 1970s, the federal courts were holding states liable for not moving quickly enough on de facto segregation. Each Connecticut city worked independently with the commissioner of education to develop individual desegregation plans. But, city officials claimed that they could not desegregate schools within a city. City officials claimed that the racial imbalance act was racist because it put such a positive value on “whiteness” and a negative value on “blackness.” They believed the only way desegregation could happen was through a regional effort. Officials from Hartford, New Britain, New Haven, Norwalk, Stamford and Waterbury all signed a statement to that effect. In 1976, for the first time, the state Board of Education drew up regulations to carry out the racial imbalance law. In the context of the busing uproar in Boston, Connecticut officials were understandably nervous about any forced busing and it took them seven years to write up the regulations, which allowed for the 25% more or less minority students at a school than the town’s school system average. With these regulations, virtually all-white suburbs, and all-black cities would not change. The regulations did not mandate busing, or any specific means to achieve racial balance. It was clear that the only true integration would come from student transfers across town lines. From 1969 to 1979, Connecticut schools became more segregated. Superintendent Richter chose to champion voluntary busing in West Hartford before the Racial Balance Act, before the riots, and twelve years after Brown v. Board of Education. In 1970, The West Hartford and Hartford Boards of Education agreed to a recommendation to double the number of Project Concern students in West Hartford to almost 400. According to Richter, integration made for good schools. He believed “That good schools can make a community a better place in which to live. Good schools attract good people.” With this spirit, Richter and the Board of Education defined a positive role for West Hartford’s schools in its voluntary efforts to integrate at a time when the West Hartford community itself was not integrated. When Teachers Marched in Protest Down Farmington Avenue Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, February 2004 Between 1969 and 1975, West Hartford teachers grew militant in their demands for a negotiated contract. In April 1970, teachers marched from Hall High School (the present Town Hall) in the center of town down Farmington Avenue to the old East School on Whiting Lane to protest lack of action on their contract by the Board of Education. Negotiating a contract led to terrific tension between taxpayers, teachers, and the Board of Education. The West Hartford Education Association (WHEA) claimed that teachers had few rights in the classroom and the Board was caught between supporting its teachers and raising taxes. Up until the late 1960s, Boards of Education acted paternalistically toward their teachers and felt they had the prerogative to establish all working conditions and pay. It wasn’t until the mid 1960s that there was actually a written salary schedule for teachers in West Hartford. In 1968-69, Farmington teachers drew up a contract for the first time. In the fall of 1968, Hartford teachers went on strike over class size and working conditions. In July 1969, eight Connecticut towns were in arbitration. The 1960s were a time for direct action and a time when ordinary citizens fought for equality and democracy and teachers would not be denied their rights. Just flexing their union muscles, however, could only work with the power of the 1969 state law making boards negotiate with their unions. In 1969, the West Hartford Board of Education chose to test the new Teacher Negotiation Act passed by the state legislature in 1969. They tried to keep total control over working conditions and keep salaries at what they considered to be a reasonable level. The new law made it necessary for the Board to negotiate all areas of teachers’ employment. In 1969, the WHEA attempted to negotiate a contract with the Board of Education for both teachers and administrators. When a three man arbitration panel came up with a package after 22 failed negotiation sessions, and failed mediation, the Board, led by chair John Hand Conard, (son of Frederick U. Conard) rejected the proposal. Traditionally West Hartford had been about 5th in teachers’ salaries in the state. The proposal offered by the Board of Education would have dropped them to 15th. With 29 different issues on the table, the Board moved only on salary and refused to change its position on any other issue since negotiations began. President of the WHEA, Dick Blaisdell understood that the idea of collective bargaining came from teachers, not from the board. He believed that the board needed to be reminded that collective bargaining for teachers was a right guaranteed by state statutes and not a favor to be dispensed. He said, “The Board’s expressed attitude is reminiscent of that which prevailed 30 years ago when the superintendent of schools was a father figure before whom teachers trembled and the board was completely unapproachable. That day has long passed and if the present superintendent doesn’t soon realize this, good teachers will continue to leave West Hartford in serious numbers.” The Superintendent was Charlie Richter, known as a brilliant idea man. But he was also known for being arrogant by Board members and teachers alike. Blaisdell stated publicly that the Board, with Richter as its representative, was running roughshod over the teachers. When negotiations and mediation failed by the end of June 1970, the process moved onto a three person arbitration panel. The arbitrators made their decision in late August and the Board, rejected their proposal. Teachers, including almost 130 new professionals, started a new year without a contract. Under the new law, the arbitration was not binding. On October 8, the Board rejected an arbitration decision which included salary proposals of $7,100 for a first year teacher with a BA up to $15,400 for a teacher with PhD and 17 years experience. Richter’s salary stood at $34,500. Board Chair Conard rejected the settlement because it would have cost the town an additional $200,000 out of a budget of $13 million (about 1.5%). A further issue was that the awards “take away the Board’s power of decision over matters of educational policy.” These matters included binding arbitration over teacher grievances and release time for union business. So, the struggle continued for another six months. Teachers did not want to go on strike, but they continued to look for ways to get the public’s attention. This led to the march down Farmington Avenue and then a final settlement before the end of the school year. Five years later, in 1975, the Board and WHEA found themselves deadlocked again. At this point, the school population was declining and the issue of staff reduction was of key importance as the number of students in the school system continued to shrink and thus teachers had to be laid off. The school population hit its peak in 1970 with over 13,000 students, and the hiring of over 100 teachers in that year. By 1975, the number had shrunk to about 11,000 in 20 schools, and continued a decline for another 14 years, hitting its lowest point in 1989 at about 7,000. (In 2004 there were about 10,000 students in 15 schools.) Negotiations began in November of 1974. The WHEA used a series of “pressure tactics” to get the school board to compromise including a boycott of a superintendent’s meeting a, a three-week work slowdown, an all nighter spent in each school, and then a strike vote. Marilyn Miller, a WHEA officer and negotiator, said she would go on strike “because of what I’ve seen in West Hartford these past ten months… the apathy of the public and the parents.” She went on to say that she believed that teachers were “the only group of people in West Hartford who care about education.” On October 6, the New York Times covered the all night protest held by the teachers. They stayed overnight in their schools trying to bring attention to their plight without going on strike. At the beginning of November, teachers voted to give the leadership the ability to go on strike. Donald LaCroix, president of the WHEA and a kindergarten teacher, reported that 55% voted to use the strike as pressure for settlement. LaCroix believed that at least 50% of those who voted against the strike would not cross the picket line. Experts believed that to make the strike effective, 80% had to participate. The rejected proposal called for 5% increase in the first year, 6.85% in the second year, and 6.9% in the third year. The school board offered 4.25%. Inflation was running between 6 and 8% at this time. The teachers angered Board member Richard Roth because he felt they had voted to take part in a “blatantly unlawful and illegal act.” He said he was having a difficult time explaining to his children how they should respect their teachers when the WHEA decided to strike. To make matters worse for the teachers, on November 5, Assistant Superintendent of Personnel Donald Hardy reported that the school board had a $1 million deficit. This deficit was one of the main reasons the school board had been loathe to accept the arbitration award for teachers. At the same meeting, the Board authorized teacher layoffs, replacement and salary deductions for those who went on strike. In 1975, just as today, strikes by teachers were illegal in the state of Connecticut and school boards asked the courts for an injunction against the teachers. Assistant Superintendent of Schools Paul Burch said that this would not be done; instead, he stated that they would lay off striking teachers by random selection. At that point, teacher and school board negotiators started a series of marathon negotiating sessions and with the help of mediators, came up with a three year contract signed in the first week in December. The final contract included a moratorium on staff reductions until 1977 and gave teachers binding arbitration of selected contract items for the first time. In December 2003, West Hartford Teachers voted to approve a contract negotiated by the West Hartford Education Association and the West Hartford Board of Education, giving teachers a 2% raise in each of the next two years. About 75% of the teachers approved the two year contract which went into effect in September 2004. This contract was negotiated during an economic downturn but also at a time with strong town support for the school system. Binding arbitration has helped to level the playing field between teachers and boards of education giving teachers the rights that most industrial workers got in 1935 with the Wagner Act. The power of the state law has made negotiations more civil and less divisive as both sides are pushed to be reasonable. Save Our Reservoir: The Fight to Stop I-291 January 2018 The 1950s and 1960s were a time of intense highway planning and development across the U.S. West Hartford was no exception. Have you ever noticed the four-level stack of highway exits and entrances on I-84 that lead to nowhere near the Route 9 entrance near West Farms Mall? The federal and state governments built this stack, from 1969 to 1973, to connect to highway I-291, planned to encircle the city of Hartford. It’s a highway to nowhere because a group of citizens, led by Charlotte Kitowski fought this highway project. This group, the Committee to Save the Reservoir (CSR) is a textbook example of citizen advocacy. In 1957, the federal government began to design and build highways around cities to reduce congestion. The I-291 route was to be 27 miles long, running from Rocky Hill around to Windsor, going through West Hartford to Simsbury Road (Route 185) with an interchange at North Main Street (Route 218), One of the motivations for this particular highway was the arrival in 1957 of Connecticut General Insurance Company in Bloomfield – right near the proposed interchange. Looking north from a point in Farmington, the “stack to nowhere” shows the beginnings of the connector to Route 291, a circular highway that was never built through the MDC Reservoir. Note the monastery, and the Buena Vista development. You can also see Veteran’s Memorial Skating Rink on Cornerstone Drive. Soource: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society. In 1959, the state’s Department of Transportation received funding to plan this connector between I-84 and I-91. At the time, the government projected that West Hartford would grow by 40,000 people to 100,000 by the year 2000 and that these people would need a limited access highway to move people around the region more quickly. Kitowski and CSR, did not see moving people faster as a sign of progress. And they took the chance to make their case against this highway expansion. The Federal Highway Act of 1956 required officials to get citizen input from those affected by new highways, through public hearings. The goal was to get input to understand “the overall ecological balance in communities and their capacity to absorb disruption” before building the highways. In June 1960, West Hartford citizens attended the first hearing for this highway at Duffy School. Legislators argued that the interstate should go through the MDC Reservoir instead of the route through neighborhoods where they would have to tear down many houses. Charlotte Kitowski (1923-2005) spearheaded the fight to stop this highway. A nurse by profession, she became a dedicated environmentalist in the battle to stop Route 291’s path through the Greater Hartford Metropolitan Water System. And she had the experience and skills to win the fight. She and her husband moved to West Hartford in 1950 and raised three children at 50 Arnoldale Road. In the 1950s, she worked with others in town to oppose Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee as they tried to root out dissent during the Cold War. In September 1963, just three weeks after the March on Washington, the Connecticut Council of Churches asked her to sit on a strategy committee to address “race problems” to improve the lives of African Americans in the state in terms of housing, jobs, and history textbooks (She was the only woman on this committee). She expressed her ideals around community engagement like this: “People say there’s nothing you can do. I’ve just never had that feeling… Challenging the government is the way the government works!” In 1969, Kitowski helped organize the community to challenge the new highway plan. A high school student drafted a petition to stop the highway and circulated it at Conard, Hall, Plant Jr. High, the West Hartford Academy and Hartford College for Women. Kitowski engaged with and supported these students. The actions of the high school students and Kitowski’s organizing experience led to the formation of the Committee to Save the Reservoir (CSR) CSR organized its first event, the Reservoir Ramble, on May 25, 1969. About 140 citizens attended this rally at the MDC Reservoir on Farmington Avenue. The event garnered some press and more activists to circulate petitions against the highway. In nine days they had 6,700 signatures on their petition. They delivered the petition which grew to 10,000 signatures to Democratic Governor John Dempsey. The petitions and a resolution from Town Councillor Robert Krechevsky led to a State Highway Department public hearing on September 25, 1969. Over 1,100 people attended the public hearing at Hall High (the present Town Hall in the center of town). Students sang a song entitled “Spirit of the Reservoir” from the school steps as townspeople walked into the hearing. At the meeting, The Department of Transportation outlined the route of the highway which would be 100 feet from Reservoir 6 and less than 100 feet from Reservoir 2. Health Commissioner Dr. Franklin Foote objected to the route because of the negative effects of lead and chlorine in the water. He argued that the highway should be at least ¼ mile away from any water to reduce the risk of pollution. A biochemistry expert from Washington, D.C. and a professor from Dartmouth School of Medicine both spoke against the highway stating health risks to the water supply. The DOT summarily dismissed Health Department warnings. The Republican mayor of Bloomfield, Lew Rome, testified that both the Bloomfield Town Council and Bloomfield Planning and Zoning Commission wanted the new highway. He urged West Hartford officials to join those in Bloomfield in support of the highway. This was unpopular with many of Bloomfield citizens, particularly environmentalists. Six weeks after the Mayor’s testimony, in the November election, six of the seven Bloomfield council members did not run for reelection and Democrats won control. They quickly voted to withdraw the town’s support for I-291. After the hearing, Governor Dempsey asked Commissioner of DOT, George Conkling to address the issue of the highway through the reservoir. Conkling had no written statement of policy from the Health Department about the projected route. CSR hired an outside group to do an independent study of the area. At this point, Kitowski felt the best path was to bypass Connecticut DOT and go straight to the federal government. She urged people to write to the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, John Volpe. And, CSR continued its letter writing campaign and petitions to state, local and MDC officials. On the first Earth Day, in April 1970, CSR organized a bus tour through West Hartford; more than half of those on the tour were under 18. The buses, donated by the Connecticut Co. took riders on an ecological tour of town including where the state planned to build I-291. In September 1970, a hearing in Bloomfield drew Kitowski and CSR and 400 Bloomfield residents. In October 1970, the Federal Bureau of Public Roads, to which CSR had written, suspended the design on the Bloomfield section of I-291 in response to claims made by the U.S. Deputy Under Secretary of Transportation John Olsson after he visited the site. After this suspension, CSR felt good! In fact, the federal government declared that the next Connecticut Governor had the power to cancel the plans to build the highway, no matter what happened at the federal level. So, the power shifted from DOT to the Governor’s race between First District Congressman Emilio Daddario (D) and Sixth District Congressman Thomas Meskill. In November 1970, state voters elected former Bloomfield Mayor Thomas J. Meskill for Governor. Right away, Meskill tried to get a route further to the west, outside the reservoir, but that made the ring road too long and beyond what the federal government would subsidize. Meskill played both sides of the issue by supporting building I-291, all the time knowing that the federal government would not pay for this longer route. This win put pressure on West Hartford’s electeds to fight the interstate. West Hartford’s Democratic State Senator Jay Jackson helped pass Senate Bill 291 (yes, that WAS the bill number!) to stop the highway. CSR continued the pressure with a letter writing campaign to the Governor to sign the bill. Governor Meskill vetoed the bill in May 1971 on the grounds that he did not have the authority to stop the highway. After the veto, Kitowski got citizens from Bloomfield and Windsor to join together with her West Hartford advocates against I-291. With local citizens and state legislators organized against the highway, even the veto was not stopping them. In September 1971, Governor Meskill promised to keep the highway out of the Reservoir. CSR circulated 11,000 fliers reminding the Governor of his promise. And, they broadened the campaign to include all 386,000 people who used MDC water. This was a regional problem On September 25, 500 cyclists rode to the reservoir and gave speeches against the highway, calling their protest a “bike strike.” Kitowski quickly accessed the new federal Environmental Protection Agency, established on December 2, 1970, to get their support in this attempt to save our water. In September 1971, the new Commissioner of the EPA, William Ruckelshaus officially supported the position of CSR. In June 1972, CSR submitted a report to DOT with scientific experts voicing their concerns with the proximity of 291 to the water supply in the reservoirs. By federal law, DOT had to review the group’s report and submit an environmental impact statement to the federal government for approval. CSR retained lawyers who filed suit against DOT stating it ignored Section 4 (F) of the 1966 Dept of Transportation Act which required DOT to say that there were no feasible and prudent alternatives to the use of parklands. The suit claimed that DOT did not look at alternatives to the interstate highway such as mass transit. In August 1972, Kitowski and three CSR members traveled to Washington, D.C. to get national support for their fight. Kitowski presented a 300 page report by environmental experts to the Interior Department refuting the claims of Connecticut DOT. Federal transportation and environmental departments showed surprise at the amount of opposition to the 291 route, and requested more information. Possibly because of the previous state focus, the federal government did not even have accurate maps or information regarding the proposed route. The Department of the Interior said that DOT had to study the route again. Interior required DOT to hold another hearing back in Connecticut. In the third public hearing, October 1972. The hearing at the old Hall Conference Center drew 1,000 citizens. The Department of the Interior supported the route. The other three federal agencies did not. Republican Mayor Ellsworth Grant, the first speaker, reminded the DOT officials that he and the WH Town Council had passed resolutions opposing the highway three times and had authorized the Corporation Counsel to bring an injunction against the DOT to stop the construction. Officials made clear that federal law stipulated that if public land is to be used in development HUD, EPA, Interior and Agriculture have to be informed. CSR sent the transcripts, full of data on the threats to the area’s water supply, to Secretary of Transportation John Volpe. With continued pressure to stop the highway, Gov. Meskill killed the plans on August 2, 1973, three days after his Transportation Commissioner, who supported the route, resigned. Tied to Meskill’s change of heart on the highway was a change in Federal government regulations, allowing the state to shift the 90% reimbursement funds for this highway to other projects. The Capitol Region Council of Governments (CRCOG) then dispersed the money. In December 1974, the EPA honored Kitowski with its Environmental Achievement Award, the highest honor given by the EPA’s regional office. The regional EPA Administrator said her “actions have proved that responsible public participation can be the keystone of our environmental efforts.” Kitowski had willingly taken on the leadership of a citizen advocacy group, coordinating the campaign by using local government, public hearings, the courts, scientific studies, and the nascent environmental movement to successfully fight state and national government. As a biker, advocate and historian, one of my favorite stories happened in 1972 when DOT Commissioner Wood criticized Kitowski for driving her car on Interstate I-84 to get to a meeting at his office. He insinuated that we all need these highways, even Kitowski! At the next meeting, Kitowski rode her bike, and carried it right into Wood’s office, proclaiming there were not provisions for locking it up outside. The Hartford Courant documented her commute with two photos in the morning paper. The Agora Ballroom Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, August 2006. Thanks to Rachel Aron’s research paper, “The History of a West Hartford Hot Spot – The Agora Ballroom,” for bringing this topic to my attention. Her paper was a 2006 winner in the Noah Webster House’s Freeman and Mary Meyer Prize on West Hartford History. Her complete paper can be read at the House. Teenagers in West Hartford often decry the lack of “things to do.” When they learn about the town’s Charter Oak Park, a horse race track, or Luna Amusement Park, they wonder why there can’t be fun around like that today. Recently, plans for a laser tag venue on New Park Avenue may provide entertainment for teenagers. In the 1970s and 1980s teenagers and young adults in town could go to Dexter Avenue for boxing matches, disco dancing and concerts of emerging rock groups from Bobby and the Midnights to The Clash to Santana to Joe Jackson as they made their way to stardom. What was finally known as the Agora Ballroom at 165 Dexter Avenue, opened as a distribution warehouse for Royal Typewriter in 1963, built on top of the old West Hartford landfill (and near the present day Public Works Department). Royal stopped manufacturing typewriters in Hartford in 1968 and so the concrete rectangular building stood vacant for a while The Columbia Music Hall opened in the building in September 1973. In its short time, it held both music and sports events. On August 17, 1973, promoter Manny Liebert announced that he would once again sponsor boxing in Connecticut, now that it was legal again, at the Columbia Music Hall at 165 Dexter Avenue in West Hartford. The facility had room for 900 parked cars and could seat 2,500 people. According to the Hartford Courant, the venue was situated right in the heart of the old Hartford sports scene, not far from Charter Oak Park where both harness and auto races were held. The first bout on September 25, 1973 was the first boxing match ever to be held in West Hartford. The line up included a six fight card headlining with New Britainite Kevin Pentlow and D.G. Barber of Denver, Colorado. Liebert promised the undercard would have as many Connecticut boys as he could find. In April, a boxing line up included ex-Conard football player Howard Hall in his first professional bout. He won in two rounds over an opponent from Enfield. At the same time, there was boxing, it was also a music hall. In the second week in September, Quicksilver, one of the original San Francisco Bay Area groups played. On September 22, 1973, jazz musician Herbie Mann held a concert there. It was also a venue for local folk singers. Six local singing groups held a folk concert on January 8, 1974 to raise money for arts groups in the area. On January 12, the venue hosted three groups, Slade, a hard rock band from England, NRBQ, formally the Wildweeds from Windsor, and Brownsville Station, a hard rock band from Madison, Wisconsin. Todd Rungren sang in April of that year. In February 1974, the Music Hall hosted The Charles Brothers Circus in an attempt to raise money for summer school for children from Charter Oak Terrace, right around the corner. Two hundred people watched the indoor circus. It was even the site in January 1974 for West Hartford’s Mayor Catherine Reynolds to draw the Connecticut Lottery winner: Mrs. Bernice Schwartz of Haynes Road won $75,000. In December 1974, a group of six called Starship Enterprise bought out the Columbia Music Hall and changed the name to the West Hartford Music Hall. They lasted only until November 1975 when it changed to Finnocchio’s East, a gay bar. For a brief time from November 1975 to June 1976, the nightspot Finnocchio’s was an attraction for the gay community. Its New Year’s celebration was called the “First New Year’s Gayla Party” and featured the Arthur Blake Review. According to ads in the Hartford Courant, the Review was so popular that it was held over for four days. An attempt by entertainer Ivan Valentin to perform “Leading Ladies of New York” with his troop of female impersonators was shut down by the Connecticut state liquor commissioner in the spring 1976. Connecticut state law prohibited entertainment at a liquor establishment where men dressed as women or women dressed as men. Valentin said the show was shut down mainly because it attracted a largely homosexual crowd. Others argued that the show was seductive and dealt in sexual content. By June of 1976, the entertainment venue turned to disco and fell on hard times. In 1977 it became the Hard Rock Café, with no connection to the chain of Hard Rock Cafés. By 1979, management changed the name again to Stage West. In 1982, it became the Agora Ballroom, part of a chain of nightclubs based in Cleveland. The Agora was very popular and advertised free admission before 9:30 and 75 cent drinks. Ads enticed people to come hear Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, Max Creek, Cryer, and the Dregs. In 1982, when the drinking age was 18, the Ballroom advertised “1st Drink Free with College I.D.” The drinks were inexpensive, but part of the charm of the Agora was the tailgating in the parking lot. Attendees partied before they went in, went out to their cars at intermission and then partied again after the show ended. A stamp on their hand allowed for re-admission. The Agora parking lot became an important social gathering place. In the industrial area of town, this seemed not to cause a public nuisance, even when the Ballroom was open to 2 a.m. on weeknights and 3 a.m. on weekends. In its first few months, Joe Jackson, Bonnie Raitt, Pousette Dart Band, Willie Nelson, and Gaelic Rocker Rory Gallagher held concerts there. Over the course of its six years, The Ramones, X, Peter Gabriel, Ozzy Osborne, R.E.M., U2, Metallica, Aerosmith, Husker Du, The Grateful Dead, Twisted Sister, King Crimson, Men at Work, Stray Cats, and the Average White Band all performed. In the middle of the night in July 1987, the Agora was destroyed by vandals. It was thought to be an inside job, included stealing sound equipment, using chainsaws to cut posts holding up the balcony, and spray painting the walls. No one was ever arrested for the damage, and the venue never recovered. Max Creek saw the Agora as a home base. They went back and performed after the vandalism and they believed the Agora Ballroom was “the best place to hear live music” in the area.The managers hosted a wide variety of music and bands which “defined the times,” including The Band, Missing Person, John Cippolina, and Peter Tosh. It also served as a spot, like the Webster Theater in Hartford today, for local and regional bands to get their start. According to Mark Mercier of Max Creek, it was “in many people’s minds, the best place in the area to hear music, and since then, no place in Connecticut and western Massachusetts has come close to what it was. We had a wonderful time playing there.” This nightclub provided a venue for emerging groups and entertainment for those in the region that was edgy and fun. My guess is that teenagers in town couldn’t wait until they were old enough to go to the Agora. Recycling Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, April 2011 On January 27, 1971 Republican Deputy Mayor Arthur Fay proposed stricter controls on dumping in West Hartford. Since November 1957, West Hartford had incinerated about 60,000 tons of solid waste per year, about one ton per person per year, and about 4 pounds per day. By 1971, the town government knew that the landfill was almost full and the incinerator would need to be replaced. Fay’s proposed town ordinance would require residents to separate newspaper from trash for recycling and would assess businesses a $5 dumping fee. The idea for the ordinance came out of a proposal to build a new regional incinerator for West Hartford, Newington, Rocky Hill, and Newington at a cost of $27 million. Fay believed this new incinerator could be delayed for 10 to 15 years, by implementing a paper-recycling program. At the time, 46% of the town’s waste came from corrugated boxes, magazines, newspapers, and paper bags. And, for business, of the 250 tons of trash produced each week, 200 tons was recyclable. But, business leaders questioned Fay’s statistics and claimed it was costly to separate their trash and take staples and tape off the boxes. Fay retorted that “more money is spent by industry in advertising their concern for ecology, than on their performance in demonstrating their concern.” In September, the ordinance was tabled with only Fay voting in favor. Local businessmen had grave reservations about the dumping fees and the strict regulation of refuse collection that the ordinance prescribed. Leaders from Wiremold, Chandler Evans, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Jacobs Manufacturing, Dunham Bush, and Holo-Krome all believed that further study needed to be made. They argued that businesses would move out of town if the ordinance were passed. By May 1972, Fay reintroduced his ordinance with changes for residents. This ordinance made residential newspaper recycling participation mandatory. Residential garbage would not be picked up if newspapers were mixed with the trash. The bi-weekly newspaper-recycling program had had moderate success over the year. Town garbage collectors picked up about 30 tons of newspapers per week from private residents. Fay felt that with required recycling, the town could move to weekly recycling pickup. Fay’s ordinance was passed in June, requiring weekly newspaper recycling. Fay chose to drop the dumping fees from the ordinance and West Hartford’s Town Council adopted a mandatory residential newspaper-recycling program in May 1972. In 1972, Fay was eager to get to the 50 tons of cardboard produced by business that was thrown away each week. Fay continued to remind townspeople that putting the paper in the incinerator cost $6 per ton and for every ton of paper recycled, 17 fewer trees needed to be chopped down. The Council left businesses out of the recycling program. Their concern about the cost of cleaning up their contaminated corrugated boxes led them to lobby to stop the ordinance. At the same time, the Chamber of Commerce started to survey the recycling potential of town businesses. Councilman Brian O’Meara called for the creation of a joint committee of business leaders and town administrators to take a cooperative approach to recycling efforts. By June 1973, Fay encouraged voluntary participation on the part of businesses. By October 1973, Fay claimed that the town recycled 60 tons of newsprint per week, about 60% of the newsprint in town. West Hartford sold the paper to recyclers and paid less in incineration fees. At that time the State Department of Environmental Protection was just starting a statewide recycling program and looked to West Hartford as a model. In February 1975, Democratic Town Councilor Daniel Blume proposed an ordinance that would end newspaper recycling. The recycled newsprint market had declined and Blume claimed the recycling cost too much. Barbara Blechner, leader of the Environmental Quality Committee of the League of Women Voters helped lead the fight to keep newspaper recycling in place. The League issued an eight-page report to change the way recycling was picked up. In East Hartford, Bloomfield, Newington and Norwalk special units were attached to regular garbage collection trucks so that newspapers could be picked up at the same time as garbage. In 1975, the town’s landfill was close to being filled, requiring the town to take some trash out of town. So the pressure was on to solve the problem. The League saw the issue as a more global problem than the Town Council. According to the League, to make 1000 tons of low grade paper from virgin pulp was 3,400 times greater than to make the same paper out of recycled material. The League also understood that the cost to address waste problems not only including burning the trash, but also the fringe benefits and debt cost of collection and transportation of the waste. By 1976, Republican Mayor Nan Streeter continued to encourage recycling. The Town Council issued a proclamation on March 16, 1976 declaring March 21 to March 28 “Recycle Newspaper Week.” Streeter, an avid member of the League, wrote that because the town believed that a healthy environment was vital to life, and that the incineration of newspapers increased air pollution, and the town collected newspapers, that residents should increase their efforts to recycle newspapers over this week. In April 1975, Democrats on the Town Council rescinded the paper-recycling ordinance. The ordinance gave the director of the Department of Public Works the authority to establish recycling rules. The League of Women Voters strongly favored continuing the recycling ordinance. The League published a mimeographed script entitled “West Hartford Trash – It Won’t Go Away – Where Will it Go?” dated October 5 and 6, 1976. This marked the culmination of a long study by the League of Women voters on the issue of Solid Waste Disposal in West Hartford. But Democratic Councilor Blume continued to argue that the recycling program cost the town too much money. Proposals included having residents take their bundled papers to one of the 5 fire stations in town or changing back to bi-weekly pickup. Republicans questioned his numbers and believed that the 50% of those who recycled weekly would not stop. They held onto the recycling program. Then in 1977, the state DEP ordered the town’s incinerator to close and the town could not avoid its solid waste issues. At this point, West Hartford bought into the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority and we trucked our wastes out of town. In that same year, Councilor Bob Farr urged schools to begin their recycling program. Farr believed that the town could save money with the program and that students would learn the habits of recycling and bring those good habits home. The progress in institutionalizing school recycling continues to today. In 2010, West Hartford produced about 38,000 tons of solid waste, about 3.5 pounds per person per day, a decrease from 1971. At the same time, Town Manager Ron Van Winkle estimated that the town will recycle only about 7,200 tons of waste –- about .6 pounds per person per day or 240 pounds per year, about 15% of the total waste produced. As of January 1, 2010 the town uses single stream recycling with automated dumping which has increased recycling. Even that rate of recycling will save the town over $100,000 by reducing fees for non-recyclable waste. Solid waste disposal is as expensive today as it was 40 years ago. But as landfills have closed, the push to reduce waste increases. Every individual can take their lead from Art Fay and the League of Women Voters to do their part to reduce, reuse and recycle. How many households can put more in their recycling bin than in their garbage? Democracy and School Renovations Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, March 2012 On February 21, 1973, 350 parents and their children marched from Trout Brook and Farmington Avenue up to South Main Street and the Town Hall to protest a proposed $15 million school renovation program. The marchers from Smith, Whitman, and Morley schools were worried about potential school closings and changes to their schools. Protesters from Wolcott, Elmwood and Beach Park schools also marched. When they arrived at the Town Hall, they circled the Noah Webster Statue calling for Mayor Ellsworth Grant to appear to speak to them. Three Democratic Town Councilors showed up in support and State Representative Chuck Matties showed up to observe the protest. Why would parents oppose renovations to their aging school buildings in the early 1970s when the state offered a 50% reimbursement rate, the unemployment rate was at 6% and the school system was seen as one of the best in the state? As for any protest, there are multiple causes and this public display of displeasure with local government fits that bill. Declining enrollment, aging school buildings, a new philosophy of “open classrooms,” a call for neighborhood schools, fear of security, democracy on the neighborhood level, a determined school board chair, and a superintendent with big ideas all came together to cause unrest. West Hartford’s population peaked in 1970 with about 70,000 residents and then lost about 10,000 over the next decade. What residents wouldn’t have known in 1971, was that five elementary schools and two junior highs would be closed over the next decade as the school population declined as well. In 1971, Superintendent Charlie Richter moved to renovate all 19 town schools over the next three years. Charter Oak and Morley Schools were in the first of three phases and were characterized as overcrowded and without adequate facilities. Both schools were over 40 years old. Charter Oak had been built without a gym and both schools lacked many large rooms that could be used for multiple small group or single large group instruction. By January 1972, Board Chairperson Madeline McKernan argued that the real reason for renovation was to “equalize facilities in the 13 elementary schools.” McKernan argued for more space for art, music, science labs, pupil series, teacher work areas, and some resource centers. The Board wanted to renovate eight schools at once in this first phase so that parents at specific schools were not able to push their agenda over that of another school. The eight schools in the first round were Bugbee, Braeburn, Whiting Lane, Charter Oak, Morley, Plant and Sedgwick Junior Highs and Conard High School. By early March 1972, the plan had already shifted to focus on schools in the southeast sector of town. A joint Town Council-Board of Education building committee came up with a plan to replace Elmwood (1928), Smith (1915) and Charter Oak Schools (1929) with a single facility built to educate 1,000 elementary students. According to Albert J. Marks, committee chair, this school would only be built if the parents of the children in the three schools liked the idea. Board of Ed chairperson McKernan said the committee believed the new school would cost little more than the $1.5 million it is estimated to renovate the three elementary schools. Both Marks and McKernan agreed that the plan would have many advantages. It would cut administrative and upkeep costs. There could be more efficient staffing with full time art, music and physical education teachers. “The latest education concepts” could be more effectively built in a new school. The three unused sites could be turned over to the town and become income producing. Building the large school on a “house system” would help retain a small-school feeling. At the first presentation, the joint committee asked PTA representatives from each school to take the information back to their schools. According to Marks, “If the town doesn’t want it, it doesn’t go. I want to make that very, very clear.” Almost immediately, parents from the Elmwood School reacted negatively to the plan. Quickly Supt. Richter readjusted and suggested that Elmwood have the option of doubling up with Wolcott School, while Smith joined with Charter Oak. The Board already had a plan to build a 14 room addition on Wolcott and it would probably only take a few more rooms to take on Elmwood’s students who lived in a small district with a school that needed too many renovations to fix. Fears of security raised their ugly head as well. The crowd applauded a woman who said that she would not allow her children to go to a school at Sterling Field because “there are certain sections there of people who are apt to be violent.” In the summer of 1970 there were problems there, allegedly from Hartford teenagers who lived in the Charter Oak Housing Project just over the Hartford line. Elmwood parents voted to consolidate with Wolcott. Byt the end of March, the joint committee believed it had a solution, with both Smith and Charter Oak parents appearing to favor consolidation and a new school for 700 students at a cost of about $1.8 million. Though some Smith parents wanted the new school built on the Smith site, the 50% state reimbursement could not be used there because the site was so small. Smith teacher Ralph Worth told the audience that the acoustics were terrible, the heating erratic and the atmosphere depressing. He added that the Smith staff completely supported consolidation. However, when the plan was brought to a vote, only 26% of the parents voted and there was no mandate. Charter Oak parents voted for renovation, Smith parents were split, and Elmwood parents supported consolidation with Wolcott. At Charter Oak, the biggest fear seemed to be losing Sterling Field. By November 1972. The Board decided to close Smith School and expand and renovate Charter Oak. At the same time the Board backed a plan to build a new Morley School on the site of the old St. Agnes home on Steele Road. By this time, parents at Smith organized a Save Our School committee that organized the protest march. Morley School parents organized a Concerned Morley Community group because they did not want a new school on Steele Road. The Smith group sought a referendum on the entire $15 million bonding ordinance. Board Chair McKernan continued to try to fix the schools. New charges that the plan was an attempt to get rid of neighborhood schools reflected a fear of busing in the time of volatile school integration battles being fought all over the country. McKernan argued that it was impossible to have all students walk to school in this town. McKernan continued to focus on the long range plan for the system in which “every child in this town has a right to an equal educational opportunity and that it should make no difference where any child happens to live and go to school.” On June 5, 1973, West Hartford voters went to the polls and defeated the $2.6 million bonding ordinance by 3 to 1. Just two months later, Superintendent Charlie Richter resigned under pressure because, according to the Board, he was out of touch with the town. It wasn’t until December 1974 that the Board finally approved plans to renovate Charter Oak, Smith and Morley schools. In 1975, the estimated cost had risen to $4.7 million. The renovations were completed in 1976. Inequities of Athletic Opportunities for Girls Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, July 2002 I can still see point guard Patty Gruzden, long hair streaming behind her in her green Talcott Junior High uniform, dribbling down Sedgwick’s basketball court after a steal and going in for the lay up. She was a tenacious, feisty, quick and truly competitive 7th grader in my first year in West Hartford. I started teaching and coaching at Talcott Junior High in 1977, five years after Title IX became law. I coached the girls’ junior varsity field hockey and basketball teams. We had a six game season playing home and away at Plant, Sedgwick and King Philip. One of the greatest satisfactions as a coach was feeling the excitement and accomplishment of those 12 and 13-year-old girls from Elmwood as they entered the gym at Sedgwick, feeling confident they could compete. In 1979, due to declining enrollment, Talcott and Plant were closed and the 9th grade moved to Conard High School. I coached freshman field hockey and JV softball. Based on my own observations and a study done by the Women’s Sports Foundation in 1997, these student athletes gained confidence, had higher self-esteem, and were less likely to get in trouble in school, use drugs, or participate in risky sexual behavior. But, West Hartford dropped competitive sports in the middle school in that same year. What implications did West Hartford’s dropping competitive sports in the junior high/middle school in 1979 have on girls over the next 20 years? A cursory view of the statistics in the year 2000 would say: very little. In 2000, 47% of girls at Conard participated in a sport. But, a closer look at the statistics, and the changing population in West Hartford over those 20 years reveals a far more complicated and disturbing story. A recent master’s thesis by Tom Moore, a history teacher and football and girls lacrosse coach at Conard, raises a host of concerns. When Title IX became law in 1972, Conard did not have any official varsity sports for girls. Title IX mandated that the school offer competitive sports for girls that would be comparable to the boys. Teams in swimming, field hockey, basketball, track and field, and tennis were the first sports offered to girls. Around the same time that Title IX became law, the population in West Hartford began to change. The population of the town peaked in 1970 at about 70,000. Over the next decade, the population decreased by 10,000 and the demographics of the town changed as more immigrants and racial minorities moved to town. This was part of a larger national trend as northern cities lost population at an even higher rate, and a new immigration law in 1965 opened the doors to more non-European immigrants. As the town’s population declined, the socioeconomic makeup of the town began to change. In 1972, the Piper Brook Housing Project opened in the southeast section of town. This was the first low-income housing for non-senior citizens in town. For the first time, low-income families could find apartment housing in West Hartford. From 1958 to 1970, Conard’s minority enrollment was less than two percent. According to Moore, five African Americans, three Asian and two Hispanic students graduated from Conard out of a total of 6,583 students during that time period. In 1973, one Hispanic girl, the only minority graduated with 495 others. By 1980, 4.5 percent of the graduating class was minority and by 1981, 10 percent. By 1991, the minority population stood at 20 percent and by 2000 was 35 percent. Today Hispanics make up the largest percentage of minorities at 14 percent. How have these demographic changes played out in sports participation? West Hartford has succeeded in providing high school girls the opportunity to compete, but the statistics show that young women of color and particularly African American and Hispanics have not benefited from Title IX in an equal way. The great majority of the participating minority females were of Asian background. They make up as much as half of the cross country and volleyball teams and participate in a rate higher than their 9 percent of the population. With the exception of cheerleading, since 1990, only two Hispanic girls earned varsity letters out of 2,138 letters earned and both of those came in softball. What factors, beyond pure individual choice, would make it so that less than 10 percent of Conard’s female athletes from a background other than Caucasian participate in sports? Why should this be of any concern for the schools where many believe the priority should be academics, not athletic competition? Conard girls who play sports are high achieving students, according to Moore’s study. In the year 2000, 83 percent of the female athletes made the honor roll. Between 1973 and 2000, 1,201 students were inducted in the National Honor Society. The NHS draws about 10% of the senior class. Of this group, 70 percent were female. Since 1986, over 60 percent of the senior girls who won varsity letters were members of NHS. The peer group that plays sports, though, seems difficult for African American and Hispanic girls to enter. For the most highly competitive sports of soccer and softball (only 60 percent of those who try out for softball make it), it is possible that they are not able to play competitively before high school to have the skills to make the team. Since 1979, West Hartford Public Schools have offered no competitive sports for middle school students. There are opportunities for girls to play on teams before high school, but only for those with the money to pay and parents available to cart them to games. These findings present policy implications for the school system. The main thrust of Title IX is to provide equality between boys and girls, but the ideal of Title IX is equal access for participation. An unintended consequence of the current West Hartford policy gives girls whose parents can pay for them to play in town and travel leagues before high school, a real advantage when they try out as freshmen. West Hartford’s pay for play rule may also keep some students from trying a new sport. Though money is available for scholarships, many students do not access it. Sports seem to have added to a division in the student body by race and economics, an unplanned result of Title IX. Can we establish policies that produce sports teams that mirror the ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic diversity of our schools that we are so proud to celebrate? Moore suggests that the town drop pay for play. He makes a case for the power of minority coaches as role models. And he suggests mandatory participation in at least one after school activity each year for every student. But it seems like high school is too late. Why not bring back sports teams at the middle school? Even the amount of time students spend in gym has declined in the past few years. The new magnet middle school would be a great place to pilot a program, which made sports an integral part of the school day. If sports help develop confidence and risk-taking behavior which seems to improve academic performance, as Patty Grusden showed me 25 years ago, shouldn’t all students have access to these opportunities? Controversy Over the New Town Hall Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, July 2002 I can still see point guard Patty Gruzden, long hair streaming behind her in her green Talcott Junior High uniform, dribbling down Sedgwick’s basketball court after a steal and going in for the lay up. She was a tenacious, feisty, quick and truly competitive 7th grader in my first year in West Hartford. I started teaching and coaching at Talcott Junior High in 1977, five years after Title IX became law. I coached the girls’ junior varsity field hockey and basketball teams. We had a six game season playing home and away at Plant, Sedgwick and King Philip. One of the greatest satisfactions as a coach was feeling the excitement and accomplishment of those 12 and 13-year-old girls from Elmwood as they entered the gym at Sedgwick, feeling confident they could compete. In 1979, due to declining enrollment, Talcott and Plant were closed and the 9th grade moved to Conard High School. I coached freshman field hockey and JV softball. Based on my own observations and a study done by the Women’s Sports Foundation in 1997, these student athletes gained confidence, had higher self-esteem, and were less likely to get in trouble in school, use drugs, or participate in risky sexual behavior. But, West Hartford dropped competitive sports in the middle school in that same year. What implications did West Hartford’s dropping competitive sports in the junior high/middle school in 1979 have on girls over the next 20 years? A cursory view of the statistics in the year 2000 would say: very little. In 2000, 47% of girls at Conard participated in a sport. But, a closer look at the statistics, and the changing population in West Hartford over those 20 years reveals a far more complicated and disturbing story. A recent master’s thesis by Tom Moore, a history teacher and football and girls lacrosse coach at Conard, raises a host of concerns. When Title IX became law in 1972, Conard did not have any official varsity sports for girls. Title IX mandated that the school offer competitive sports for girls that would be comparable to the boys. Teams in swimming, field hockey, basketball, track and field, and tennis were the first sports offered to girls. Around the same time that Title IX became law, the population in West Hartford began to change. The population of the town peaked in 1970 at about 70,000. Over the next decade, the population decreased by 10,000 and the demographics of the town changed as more immigrants and racial minorities moved to town. This was part of a larger national trend as northern cities lost population at an even higher rate, and a new immigration law in 1965 opened the doors to more non-European immigrants. As the town’s population declined, the socioeconomic makeup of the town began to change. In 1972, the Piper Brook Housing Project opened in the southeast section of town. This was the first low-income housing for non-senior citizens in town. For the first time, low-income families could find apartment housing in West Hartford. From 1958 to 1970, Conard’s minority enrollment was less than two percent. According to Moore, Five African Americans, three Asian and two Hispanic students graduated from Conard out of a total of 6,583 students during that time period. In 1973, one Hispanic girl, the only minority graduated with 495 others. By 1980, 4.5 percent of the graduating class was minority and by 1981, 10 percent. By 1991, the minority population stood at 20 percent and by 2000 was 35 percent. Today Hispanics make up the largest percentage of minorities at 14 percent. How have these demographic changes played out in sports participation? West Hartford has succeeded in providing high school girls the opportunity to compete, but the statistics show that young women of color and particularly African American and Hispanics have not benefited from Title IX in an equal way. The great majority of the participating minority females were of Asian background. They make up as much as half of the cross country and volleyball teams and participate in a rate higher than their 9 percent of the population. With the exception of cheerleading, since 1990, only two Hispanic girls earned varsity letters out of 2,138 letters earned and both of those came in softball. What factors, beyond pure individual choice, would make it so that less than 10 percent of Conard’s female athletes from a background other than Caucasian participate in sports? Why should this be of any concern for the schools where many believe the priority should be academics, not athletic competition? Conard girls who play sports are high achieving students, according to Moore’s study. In the year 2000, 83 percent of the female athletes made the honor roll. Between 1973 and 2000, 1,201 students were inducted in the National Honor Society. The NHS draws about 10% of the senior class. Of this group, 70 percent were female. Since 1986, over 60 percent of the senior girls who won varsity letters were members of NHS.

Racial Unrest at Talcott Junior High, 1975 Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, May 2010 On Monday, October 13, 1975 at a Talcott Junior High school fair, a white youth “bumped” an African American student, and told the student to move out of the way. The black student retaliated by throwing an acorn at the white student who made a threatening move. The altercation escalated as the two boys had a fistfight and the African American youth’s cousin, a participant in Project Concern busing program from Hartford, joined in. A teacher broke up the fight. The next day, white students harassed African American students both on the way to school and within the school. Talcott Junior High Principal Michael Stephanian called police in on Tuesday and Wednesday to protect students. On Wednesday, as a group of African American youths walked east on New Britain Avenue toward their homes on Piper Brook, white youths taunted them from across the street. Police on the spot interrupted the incident and dispersed the two groups. African American students at Talcott were from both West Hartford and Hartford. By 1975, Hartford students in the Project Concern program, which began in 1966 with elementary school students, were attending junior high and high schools. The housing known as the Piper Brook Apartments, developed through federal money as affordable housing, opened in 1972 and many African American families moved to these apartments. By October 1975, Talcott had 601 students and 35 were African Americans, about 6% of the school’s population. In a meeting covered by a Hartford Courant reporter on Thursday, October 16, at Mr. and Mrs. Louis Thuilard’s home at 125 Hillcrest Avenue, the African American parents contended that their children were afraid and felt it necessary to carry weapons to protect themselves from the white students, some of whom were from Conard High. Some parents decided not to send their children to school on that day, fearing for their safety. Det. Kenneth O’Brien from the police youth services division, Patrolman Arnold Bockus, Human Rights Commission member Reverend David Kern, and Pearl Dash of the Department of Children and Youth Services, and the NAACP attended the meeting. A spokeswoman for the African American parents, Mrs. Louis Thuilard, asserted that school officials had not responded as quickly or as positively as they might have. Parents perceived that racial tension was “mushrooming,” and they believed that administrators were not doing enough to curb the tension. Principal Michael Stephanian believed that the incident had been blown out of proportion, claiming that the disturbance was just a problem between two individuals, not a symbol of larger racial problems in the school. He became heated when pressed and further claimed, “The eruption of this problem in light of our past history is staggering.” He said that parents had not notified him and that his staff was trained to be sensitive to problems at the school. Conard Principal Doug Christie, brought together the Conard students involved in the scuffle to discuss their issues and believed he had opened up a dialogue between the students. While Principal Stephanian downplayed the incident, African American parents kept their children home on Thursday and Friday, October 16 and 17. In a meeting at Talcott Junior High, the next day, about a dozen African American parents demanded that their children from Piper Brook Apartments, be bused to Talcott until fears about racial tension subsided. The meeting, held in a classroom at the school led to still another meeting on October 21 when town officials said they would answer the question about bus transportation. Those present at the meeting showed how seriously the town administration took the incident. Supt. Paul Burch, Board of Education Chairwoman Elizabeth Stevens, Principal Michael Stephanian, Conard Principal Doug Christie, and several Town Council members attended. From outside of the school system came Rev. David Kern from West Hartford’s Human Rights Commission, Pearl Dash, Rick Lanz, a representative of the Bridge, a spokesman from Education/Instruccion (a Hartford Civil rights group), and Det. Kenneth O’Brien. Those parents who attended the meeting asked for: Recognition that communication between the school and town officials had to improve. The administration to see the incident as more than that between two individuals; town officials needed to consider its attitudes toward the needs of “the town’s minority residents.” The NAACP to follow the matter. School officials to hire a permanent employee who would be a “visible black with some responsibility” to act as a minority children’s advocate in the schools. Louis Thuilard from Piper Brook contacted the Human Rights Commission and considered filing a complaint against the town for denying his children an equal education. While the meeting was going on, the situation at the school seemed calm. At dismissal, uniformed and plainclothes police officers hovered in the school parking lot and adjoining areas to watch for trouble. African American parents vowed to keep their students home on Monday, October 20 and Tuesday October 21 as well. The Police Chief, Francis G. Reynolds, pledged that the police would be at the school to ensure the safety of their children, but the parents did not believe their children would be safe. On October 21, parents decided to send their students back to school on Wednesday, October 22, ending a four-day walkout when school officials promised bus service for a month to and from Hillcrest Avenue for the 40 students, both black and white, who lived east of the railroad underpass. Thuilard supported the move, saying he was “encouraged” at this “first step” to deal with the racial tension at Talcott. Parents and school administration both realized that establishing the bus route was a first step. Thuillard pledged that he and other parents would talk to school officials about “long range solutions. I’m hopeful and encouraged,” he said, “we’ll get as much participation from white parents as possible.” Superintendent Paul Burch pledged bus service for one month and then a reassessment after a new Board of Education took office in November. At the same time, Ida McKenney, West Hartford resident and a Human Rights Commission member, blasted the Commission for their lack of response to the “Talcott issue.” She believed that proactive attempts to integrate could have stopped the physical harassment before it started. She asked the Commission to investigate problems at Talcott in September and they refused to put it on their agenda. When West Hartford’s population became more diverse in the 1970s, students forced town officials, educators, and parents to react. In 2010, with an achievement gap that belies the ability of African American and Hispanic students, perhaps an African American or Hispanic student advocate, like parents demanded 35 years ago, would help students negotiate their environment in a more effective way. What Kind of Town Are We? Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, May 2004 “West Hartford has style,” says Sue Wilson. Nan Glass said we have “stability and commitment” among our government officials. Flo Woodiel said she feels lucky to be able to express her left of mainstream political ideals without retribution. Dick Woodworth believes that “it is the quality of the people that, as much as anything, contributes to the rightly ballyhooed quality of life in West Hartford.” Wilson, a former Town Councilor, Nan Glass, former Mayor and Town Clerk, Flo Woodiel, community activist and Dick Woodworth, former publisher of the West Hartford News and co-chair of the Sesquicentennial Celebration all participated in interviews with Conard’s Local History classes in mid-March for the Sesquicentennial. The participants included town leaders in politics, business, social organizations and religion. They readily gave of their time to share what it meant to be involved in community leadership roles through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Ilze Krisst remembered when she moved to West Hartford in the early 1970s, joining the League of Women Voters. Many women did not work outside the home, but felt a strong sense of civic responsibility. Under her direction, the League developed its first Voter’s Guide for local elections. Members addressed issues, went home and researched them and came back to twice monthly meetings and debated them. At these lively intellectual discussions, Krisst found a comfortable and politically active peer group. Krisst remembered that many of the League women had young children and for each meeting, one of the members agreed to forego the meeting and babysit for all the children. Thirty years later, Krisst played a fundamental role in the founding of the Park Road Playhouse. Sue Wilson served on the Town Council for two terms, from 1979 to 1983. Wilson entered town politics with the first group of women riding the wave of the feminist movement. In her second election, the Democrats gained a majority and Wilson felt she could do more. West Hartford’s population had peaked in the early 1970s and a town which at one point had 23 public schools and 14,000 students had severely declining enrollment. In the mid-1970s the Whitman, Beach Park and Elmwood Elementary Schools were closed. In 1979 both Plant and Talcott Junior Highs closed. This decline led to tensions among sections of town, as well as between the Board of Education and the Town Council. In the early 1980s, the Board of Education voted to close the Smith School, in the southeast section of town. For the only time that Wilson remembered, the Town Council overruled the Board of Education to keep Smith School open. They felt it was necessary to retain the viability of the neighborhoods which surrounded the school. Wilson was particularly interested in supporting services for low and moderate income families. She went on to support the Interfaith Housing Coalition building affordable housing. Wilson took on the issue of part-time workers at the public library. She worked to establish a standard wage and benefits for these women who made the library go. She also became the first woman president of the Unitarian Universalist Church on Fern Street from 1985 to 1989. Pastor Carl Anton of the Bethany Lutheran Church came to town in the 1960s as the pastor and has stayed. The church opened in 1944 as a German Lutheran Church. The Lutheran Church in Hartford on Capitol Avenue had Swedish roots. When the church was being built during World War II, some people in town believed that the church was an arm of the German bund. Swastikas appeared in town, even though there was absolutely no connection to the Nazis. Because of this, there was never a church service held in German at his church. When Rabbi Harold Silver moved to town in 1968, he became only the second rabbi at Beth Israel, following in the footsteps of Abraham Feldman who had been rabbi since the synagogue moved to West Hartford in 1936. Rabbi Feldman established his role as a political activist through his support of the controversial busing program, Project Concern in 1966 and in his role on the Library Board. Rabbi Silver continued in the role of community activist as he supported social issues such as the Interfaith Housing Coalition’s decision to build scattered site housing for low income and disabled people. Of the 30,000 Jews who live in the Hartford area, a large percentage lives in West Hartford. Silver continues to minister to them in his role as Rabbi Emeritus. Angelo Faenza continues to leave his mark on the town through his businesses and through community service. Faenza moved to town from Hartford when he bought the Prospect Café in the 1970s. Soon a successful restaurant, in the 1990s, he opened Faenza’s on Main at Rockledge. But his restaurants were only part of his commitment to the town. In 1986, he helped to start “Celebrate! West Hartford,” the annual spring festival held in the town’s center. In 1986, the Center was not the vibrant and active place it is today. The town population had declined since the early 1970s, schools were closed down and Westfarms Mall, which opened in 1974, took away much of the business. Faenza’s leadership in this community celebration helped to spur the resurgence of the center. John Green, President and CEO of Lux, Bond, and Green, is an example of a local businessman who helps make West Hartford Center unique. Green’s great grandfather, Morris Green founded the company in 1898 in Hartford. John’s grandfather Irving became its president in 1933 and during his tenure, the West Hartford store opened in 1957 on LaSalle Road. John’s father Robert took the presidency in 1973 and in 1987, the store’s headquarters moved from Hartford to West Hartford.In 1992, at age 36, John assumed the presidency of the company. Presently there are seven stores, six in Connecticut and one in Boston. Unlike other jewelry stores, Lux, Bond &amp; Green sales personnel are not paid commission. The store prides itself on the trust they build with their customers. Green has also given back to the community through the golf tournament his company sponsors each year. In the last 14 years, the tournament has raised over $200,000 for area charities. Many of the student interviewers wondered why these community leaders volunteered so much time through their political work and community service. It is these residents that help define what makes us such a special town. Their dedication not just to their work, but also their dedication to the town helps to define the sense of care and concern that builds a community to which people are proud to belong. Thank you to students Julie Monahan, Anna Flores, Jennifer Lin, Nick Macca, Jesse Wrubel, Meredith Poltorak, Kristen Mangiafico, Ryan Kelly, Lauren Ramezanna, Joe Ryan and Jessica Feliciano for their help in recording and interpreting these interviews. Stay tuned next month for more interviews. Come to the Sesquicentennial’s Public History Day where you can hear what each of the interviewees believes make West Hartford unique. Atwood Collins Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, July 2003 In 1997, the Noah Webster House began an oral history project and collected ten interviews with long time residents. Atwood Collins (1917-2004) was one of those interviews. His story helps to develop the texture of life in the growing suburban town for a successful young lawyer. When Atwood Collins’ mother gave birth to him in 1917, she was at home on 35 North Quaker Lane. Their home was surrounded by a dairy farm owned by the Griswold family, and as he looked toward Fern and Asylum, he saw farmland, not houses. In the 1920s in West Hartford, daily life would have been a lot different than it is today. The population stood at about 9,000, the trolley had been running through town for almost 30 years, and cars were starting to be used for commuting, not just leisure time drives. Collins’ childhood reflects more the life of a rural town than a suburb. Collins remembered sledding from Mt. St. Joseph Academy, which the Sisters of Mercy opened in 1908, on West Hill to the pond at the base of the hill. At the corner of Frederick Street, on land still owned by Mt. St. Joseph, Collins remembered a baseball diamond. The horses from Troop B, what we now know as the Governor’s Foot Guard, were housed at the armory on Farmington Avenue, in smelling distance of his house. In kindergarten and first grade, Collins attended the East School on the corner of Farmington Avenue and Whiting Lane. From second grade to sixth, he went to the Fern Street School on the corner of Bretton Road and Fern Street. Morley School opened in the late 1920s at the end of his time there. Then he went to Kingswood, which moved from the Mark Twain House in 1922 to its present location. In his day, in the late 20s and early 30s, Collins related, Kingswood Masters wore mortar boards during the day and they wore black gowns to class. Only seniors could walk on the green around which the four classroom buildings stood. Where Wood Pond is today, Collins remembered the Trout Brook Ice and Feed Company’s ice storage building. Korszak Ziolkowski, the man who carved the Noah Webster Statue in 1941, lived near there. He remembers the iceman coming every week to his house with ice tongs and a block of ice over his back. He remembered an Italian man who drove a vegetable truck through their neighborhood as well. M.J. Burnhams, the grocery story in the center was where everyone shopped (until it closed in 1958), according to Collins. From Quaker Lane, his family would have gone west on Farmington Avenue, which, until the late 1920s was not paved between Trout Brook and Main Street. Steps lined the front of the store. Burnham had, according to Collins, a “tremendous following; everybody loved him.” Everyone who shopped there had credit and they paid for their groceries per month. According to Collins, “MJ Burnham was a real institution.” Myron Burnham opened his grocery store in 1898. At its peak, he had 60 employees, including people who delivered groceries, stockers, and switchboard operators. When the grocery closed in 1958, the First National Supermarket, a grocery chain, opened just south on South Main Street and Burnham’s building was torn down to make way for its parking lot. Source: Noah Webster House &amp; West Hartford Historical Society Collins graduated from Yale College and then Yale Law School in 1942. Right out of law school, at age 24, Collins was appointed State Department Vice-Consul in Punta Renas, Costa Rica. He first went to the School of Economic Warfare, US State Department in Washington D.C. to get trained on economic warfare where he “learned how to put Germans and Italians out of business in all of Latin America.” The State Department had a blacklist. When he got to his town in Costa Rica, he must have been shocked to find Germans in the street goose-stepping. The Germans and the Italians sank two boats in the harbor to make trade difficult. Part of Collins’ work was to document Argentina’s Juan Peron’s complicity with the Germans during the war. This helps explain why so many former Nazis escaped to Argentina after the war. He did this work for two years, and then served in the Army from 1944 to 1946, participating in the Occupation. In 1945, as the Political and Liaison Officer to the U.S. Delegation, he attended the San Francisco Peace Conference. He was at the first meeting of the United Nations as a specialist in Latin American affairs representing the State Department. When the war ended, President Truman sent him to the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials where he interrogated Von Ribbentrop, the Foreign Minister of Nazi Germany, 1938-1945. Von Ribbentrop was convicted of helping to start World War II and engineering the Holocaust. In October 1946, he was the first of those sentenced to be hanged. Collins’ keen recollection of these events revealed just how important they were to the development of his world view. When Collins’ turned back to civilian life and professional life in 1946, Day, Berry &amp; Howard, hired him as a lawyer at $25 per week. There were 12 men on the stationery at that time. Mr. Conning of Conning and Co. lived next door to Collins and advised him to invest in Connecticut General stock. He did, and that, according to Collins, is what allowed him to live. Collins raised his family in Sunset Farms and became a member of the Asylum Hill Congregational Church in Hartford. He gave back to the community through his work as a founder of University of Hartford, President of the Board of the Mark Twain House, the board of the American School for the Deaf, and he served on the West Hartford Town Plan and Zoning Commission. Collins’ oral history, which can be listened to at the Noah Webster House, is a reminder that our memories of growing up are an important part of a larger enterprise. Matched with other primary sources, these memories can help us to understand the events and values of life at other points in time. His experiences in the military and at the Nuremberg Trials helped him to understand the importance of a participatory democracy which he helped to build here in this growing suburb. McCue, Sinatro and Reynolds Originally appeared in West Hartford Life, June 2004 Bob McCue, Pat Sinatro, and Katie Reynolds participated in interviews with Conard’s Local History classes in mid-March for the Sesquicentennial. Public employees, business owners and elected officials like these three build bridges between different constituencies helping to develop a sense of a West Hartford community. Bob McCue, retired Chief of Police was born in West Hartford during the Great Depression. He boasts three generations serving on the WHPD. His father Martin was Chief of Police and started his service in 1929. McCue’s son, Bob, Jr. is now Assistant Police Chief. McCue joined the police force in 1952 at a time when West Hartford’s population was about 45,000 and retired in 1990 when the population stood at about 60,000. He showed interest in building bridges between the police and children and teens. In the late 1960s, there was animosity on the part of teens towards police officers that grew out of police actions towards civil rights and anti war protestors. In the 1960s McCue was one of the founders of the Police Explorers program which introduced young men and women to the career of the police officer. In 1969, McCue helped develop the “Officer Friendly” program to teach children about safety and to familiarize them with police officers. McCue and Detective Pete McDermott used these programs to encourage positive relationships between the WHPD and local teens. McCue also felt it was important within his department to teach his officers the history of the department. He wrote a column called “Roots” in the police newsletter which described the changes in the WHPD. Before the department was unionized in 1964, officers bought their own uniforms and even their badges and couldn’t get paid for overtime work. McCue’s family tie through his father, gave him the impetus to pass the stories along to members of the department to help build pride in their department and in their work. McCue remembered a closer relationship between the police and neighbors in the 1950s when he first joined the force. When the town had more of a small town feeling, residents left their house keys at the police station when they went on vacation, and during each shift, an officer checked their house. As the population grew in the 1960s, this practice had to be discontinued. Bike patrols, established in the last ten years, are an attempt by the police force to redevelop these personal relationships in neighborhoods. When Katie Reynolds ran as a Democrat for Town Council in 1971, she was the first woman of that party to be elected. In her run for re-election in 1973, she won re-election and she was also the top vote getter and became the first of four female mayors over the next 25 years. In the 1973 election, Republicans led by Ellsworth Grant lost the majority they had held for 20 of the previous 26 years. In that election, the top four vote getters were women. Reynolds’ election appealed directly to women and she dubbed her run, “the housewife’s campaign.” Reynolds rode the new wave of feminism which came out of the 1960s with the formation of the National Organization of Women in 1966 and the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment by Congress in 1972 both of which encouraged women to get involved in public life. And yet, she couched her election strategy on women being different; women, she argued, would be less partisan than men and would be more willing to make decisions for the good of the town rather than the good of the party. This same argument was used by many of the woman suffragists at the turn of the 20th century. And, politics in the 1960s and 1970s in West Hartford were wracked by partisanship as politicians, business owners and neighbors argued over developments in Elmwood, at Corbins Corner, Bishops Corner and Westfarms Mall. The mall was a $40 million development project that took a reversal of a Town Council vote in 1966 and a Supreme Court decision in 1970 to go forward. Reynolds served on the council during its creation and the mall opened when she was mayor. Reynolds has not dropped out of public life since leaving the council almost 30 years ago. She has been part of the center’s retail success with her store, Comina. Pat Sinatro owns a real estate and insurance company in the center. His company, founded in 1936 by his father, owns many of the buildings in the center on LaSalle Road and Farmington Avenue. After Westfarms Mall opened in 1974, center stores lost business. Sinatro was instrumental in revitalizing the center in the 1980s when he lured popular stores and restaurants into town and developed a climate which drew people there. He has organized “Dancing Under the Stars” for the past few years to bring people of all ages into the center. Sinatro believes both the educational and recreational facilities in town are top notch. The excellent educational system, including public, private and parochial schools, has a great reputation with area colleges. Sinatro thinks the town is particularly unique because of its recreational complex at Buena Vista which includes skating, tennis, golf and swimming, all within walking distance. At any time of day or year, people of all ages take advantage of these public facilities. West Hartford has a character all its own. The sense of community here is built around a pride in the town and a desire to make the town a great place in which to live. Elections here are always contested. Parents believe the elementary school their children go to is the best in town. Shopping opportunities abound. Recreational facilities and sports leagues provide opportunities for athletes of all ages. But it is town leaders like Sinatro, McCue, and Reynolds whose ideas and actions build the sense of community which helps make the town exceptional. Thank you to Local History students Casey O’Brien, D.J. Ehnot, Parth Thaker, Michael Abourizk, Tim Gerundo, and Andrew Reynolds for completing the interviews and analysis of these three town leaders. Thanks also to Mims Butterworth, Ellsworth Grant and Dick Woodworth for background information in their Sesquicentennial book Celebrate West Hartford. "],
["afterword.html", "Afterword", " Afterword Speech delivered at Ceremony for Dedication of Tracey’s Tree, October 9, 2017 This speech tells much about my work as Town Historian and the power of history in our lives. Delivered at Burgoyne Park in Elmwood on the occasion of planting an elm tree, now known as Tracey’s Tree. See local news: http://we-ha.com/traceys-tree-dedicated-honor-west-hartford-historian-retired-teacher-dr-tracey-wilson/ Good Afternoon! Thank you so much for this ceremony. I am humbled and honored to have this elm tree planted in my name. Who gets to have something like this?. . .and especially when I can appreciate it. In these days of consciously thinking about who should be commemorated and what statues can stand, I feel even more honored that there was consensus that I’m one for the ages. First I want to thank Rick Liftig who was the mastermind of this whole thing – and then Jenn DiCola Matos and Pam and Charlie Hilborn who helped carry out the plan. Thanks too, to the Governor’s Foot Guard - which was formed in 1771 and joined the march to the Battle of Saratoga in 1777, for adding to this celebration. And all of you who came - family Beth and Adam and Peter (and Brittany Caroline and Billie who couldn’t be here) and my brother Dave, friends, teacher colleagues, and particularly my retiree partner Liz Devine, former students, the Solidarity Sisters, Katherine who helped me pick the apples yesterday, elected officials and those of you running for elected office and members of the Universalist Church all members of this community for whom I am so grateful to be a part. Many of you gave money in my name to benefit two of my favorite non-profits – the Noah Webster House and Knox, Inc. - history and gardens are two of my favorite things! Thank you. To me, the planting of this elm tree represents a symbol in history, a community event, and a tool for educating us about liberty in a democracy. You see, trees have special significance in our environment and also as symbols – Marcus Garvey, the great black nationalist, proclaimed 100 years ago, A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin, and culture, is like a tree without roots. He knew the power that history can have in people’s lives - that knowing our history cannot only keep us rooted, but history can also give us a firm footing to branch out - to give shade, to reach the sky. And as we are seeing in Puerto Rico, even as soon as a week after the hurricane, those trees whose roots held, already have leaves sprouting. Our celebration today is about history and it coincides with the day 240 years ago in Saratoga, when American General Benedict Arnold’s troops repulsed British General Johnny Burgoyne’s troops in the Second Battle at Saratoga. This battle turned out to be a turning point in the Revolutionary War. Ten days later, General Burgoyne surrendered 5,000 British and Hessian troops to American General Horatio Gates. This battle reverberated in France, when the French told American envoy Benjamin Franklin that they would become an ally to the Americans in their fight for independence against the British. When word got back to the West Division of Hartford, Ebenezer Faxon whose homestead was on this corner, planted a small grove of elms right here, on the corner of Quaker Lane - then known as East Street and New Britain Avenue, then known as South Street. They grew and became a town landmark known as the Burgoyne Elms – properly known as the Victory over Burgoyne Elms. The idea of a regular everyday tree being a symbol is powerful. I dare say that most of us like trees – they give shade and sometimes fruit, they produce beauty when their leaves change, and they help turn carbon dioxide into oxygen. Yet these elm trees became much more. The history of the elm as a liberty tree began in 1765 as a protest to the British-imposed Stamp Act. In 1765, when the British Parliament passed the Stamp Act, Boston Patriots hung a British tax collector in effigy from an elm tree. This Stamp Act put taxes on newspapers, printed materials and college diplomas - so the protest of hanging the tax collector in effigy symbolized a desire of these Patriots for access to information, access to an education, rule by law, and individual liberty. Most historians argue that the protest was not so much about the tax, but it was more about having representation in a government that raised that tax. And I agree. So, this Liberty Tree had branches which could be used for political purposes or some might say for social change. This idea of a tree representing liberty, representing a fight against tyranny and oppression, led Faxon to plant them here on this plot of land, in what for over 200 years has been known as – Victory over Burgoyne Park. That protest demonstrated support for liberty - that we define in two ways: liberty from government tyranny and coercion liberty to participate in government I want you to try, like the Governor’s Foot Guard must every time they put on their uniforms, to think back 240 years and wonder What did liberty mean to the people who lived here 240 years ago? Was it so different from what we yearn for today? Would we understand each other’s ideal? COMMUNITY These elm trees represent these historical questions and they represent the kind of community in which we live. Faxon planted elm trees and we plant elm trees as a symbol of liberty and also a way to gather our community, to remind us that we are not just 63,000 individuals, living out our daily lives in isolation, but that our lives are made better by living in community - and by celebrating and enjoying the community in which we live. In a lot of ways a community - like Elmwood, like West Hartford - is a covenant. It is an agreement to live together – and in a covenantal relationship we ask, not what we get, but what we can give. Here many of you have given time to set up this ceremony, given money to these two great organizations, Knox and Noah Webster. I have worked to give back to the community through the writing of its history, through many years of Empty Bowls banquets, my work with the Noah Webster House, and through my leadership in the Universalist Church on Fern Street. The second definition of liberty - is the liberty to participate in government. I urge you to get involved in public service – this could mean, like my wife Beth, that you run and serve in elective office. Though politicians are criticized continuously, they are who translate and safeguard and put these ideas of liberty into action. They represent us as we relay our ideas to them for what we want government to do. Beth would tell you that as a Senator from West Hartford, she gets 2 to 3 times as many calls from constituents than other Senators. Our community’s hyper-engagement helps define our aspirations through peaceful civic engagement. That is one of the reasons we love this community so much - because its citizenry is enfranchised and empowered to make government work, something for which the Patriots fought. Being civically involved also means getting involved in organizations like the Noah Webster House and Knox Inc., the Elmwood Business Association, and the Black Lives Matter Movement. It could also mean being on the Library Board, coaching a youth sports league, advocating, like Mary Ellen Thibodeau does for safer streets for bicyclists and pedestrians, or organizing a block party in your neighborhood, or helping to organize hurricane relief for Puerto Rico. And in Elmwood and West Hartford, we celebrate this engagement. The names of our schools honor local heroes who were involved in our community. This park is now known as Blanchfield Park as a tribute to Bill Blanchfield who worked in this community and came here everyday to raise the flag. Behind us is the former Talcott Jr. High, named after James A. Talcott, a businessman who donated money and books to start our town library in 1897. Conard High School was named after Frederick U. Conard, President of Niles-Bement-Pond in Elmwood and the Chair of our Board of Education. So, I challenge you, How do you participate in your community? Not just in the past, but also today. What is your covenant with this town, your town? How do you help people make connections and build local institutions and get involved in civic life like this tree planting ceremony is doing today? EDUCATION And finally, this elm tree, I hope can be a symbol for the importance of education in our community that helps students understand what liberty is. I’d like all the teachers who are here to raise their hands and stand. I believe it is the teachers who keep our country safe, who protect our democracy, and are our biggest defenders of liberty. All teachers are models for democracy, civic discourse and critical thinking by the way they model those values in their classrooms, regardless of subject matter. And, when our Social Studies teachers teach our history and the principles of American government, students learn what freedom is. Please give them a round of applause. I feel so lucky to have had the chance to be your colleague and to serve this community as a teacher, starting right here at Talcott Jr. High in 1977 and then at Conard until 2015. As you know, I love history. I studied women’s history, African American History and Labor History in school. What all those fields have in common is that they are not the people who “won” and often their voices were not heard in the standard narrative of US History. My job, I thought, was to make their stories come alive – to give a voice to the voiceless and to try to complicate a narrative that mostly focused on men and political history. As teachers, we tell local and national stories that help us get at the historian’s enterprise: What causes change? How does an event compare to what happened in another time and place? What is the context of the event? and What changes and what remains the same? West Hartford has stories: of the Beach sisters, Bristow, Luna Park, and World War II housing, and an individual teacher’s vision all help define a community where the Beach sisters could be leaders and drive their own cars as early as 1905, where an enslaved man who bought his freedom, right before these elms were planted could get a school, Bristow, named after him in 2004, where people came by trolley to Luna Park for manufactured fun in a city of lights, where Frederick Duffy, the head of the housing authority successfully banned African Americans from living in federal housing built right near here during World War II, ironically, our 20th century fight for democracy; where in the 1970s and 80s, a school teacher, Eve Soumerai, who survived the Holocaust, even before there was Unified Theater, integrated students with disabilities into her musical theater productions. Each of these stories helps us understand the texture of our town today - and provides multiple narratives that continue in this complex inner ring suburb that we call home. These stories themselves become symbols, like this tree, of values that matter to our community. They are a way to break into student’s certainty of a single narrative, and to raise questions about who had power, and finally I hope they help give agency and voice to those who study the past. I like to think that I have lived up to the aspirations of Ebenezer Faxon, 240 years ago when he showed with his action of planting elm trees, that they would be a symbol to safeguard liberty. I believe safeguarding liberty happens in the political realm, and in our schools. I take pride in former students who chose to run for elected office including State Rep Joe Verrengia, Town Councillors Dallas Dodge and Chris Williams - and Ryan Langan who is running for office. And, when I find out one of my former students has become a teacher my heart jumps. I think of Katy Worth McCarthy, Kevin Liftig, Diana Coyne, Melissa Behrens, Anne McKernan, Leslie Hadra, Steve O’Meara, Emily Goetz, Kelly McCormick Brouse, Anna Bennett, Michael Bennett, Ebony Jones, Morgan Reed, big Carl Johnson, and many more. This job of teaching students how to live an examined life is passed from one generation to the next. Like the idea of liberty embodied in these elm trees, our teaching reverberates beyond our classroom. So thanks once again for this great honor. I am so happy to have moved to this community 40 years ago and today to feel rooted in this place – You have allowed me to branch out, to plant seeds, and to provide shade for students and people who needed it. And in this past year and a half as I have had to learn to live with cancer, I have been so grateful to my family, friends, and this community for your support. Without you, I don’t think I’d be here today, basking in this day, on this busy corner, just aching to get to the apples and doughnut holes! Thank you! "]
